[{"body": "Zemanta's API is an excellent tool for companies that are looking to sort through a lot of web content and make sense of it.\nCurata, a business grade end-to-end curation software, today unveiled their integration and partnership with Zemanta to launch \"Image Recommendations\". The recommended images can be used for all aspect of the product, including curated content, curated topics and original blog content.\n\"Zemanta is very excited to have Curata as one of our API customers. We're looking forward to helping their users find great curated content,\" said Bostjan Spetic, CEO, Zemanta.\nHow does this work? When Curata's users identify an article that they would like to curate and publish on their Curata site and the article doesn't have any images, the users can use Zemanta's image recommendations to find an appropriate image to add to the article to increase engagement.\nAccording to Bivha Singh, VP of Products, Curata, \"this complements the current capability of our software, enabling our customers a larger choice of images from which to select. We found that articles with pictures generate 47% more click-thru activity than articles without pictures based on our Curation Habits report conducted earlier this year\".\n\"This is another fantastic use of Zemanta's industry leading semantic web API and Curata is a great partner to have in our corner,\" said Tin Dizdarevic, Marketing Director, Zemanta.\nCurata provides easy-to-use marketing solutions for content curation and content marketing. It allows marketers to quickly find, organize and share content on specific issues or topics in order to establish thought leadership, own industry conversations and drive qualified web traffic. Curata was founded in 2007 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.\nZemanta is a leading semantic service for bloggers that helps them blog better, easier and faster. By suggesting related posts, pictures, relevant in-text links and tags, bloggers can enrich their posts in a way to get more traffic, more clicks, more recommendations and to make their posts look more attractive. Zemanta was launched in 2007 after being chosen as a winner of Seedcamp.\nThe post Curata Is Zemanta's New API Customer appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Curata Is Zemanta's New API Customer"}, {"body": "So, to set the record straight, we must first get to know the two curiously black and white animals that we either love or hate (more often the latter) which represent the two most recent Google algorithm changes: the panda and the penguin.\nPanda\nReleased in February 2011, this major update was created with the purpose of reducing the rankings of low quality sites. The overall goal was to improve the searcher's experience (as is with most Google updates) by forcing webmasters to remove low quality content. This content includes, but is not limited to:\nDuplicate (or low proportion of original) content.\nContent that has an unnatural keyword density (keyword stuffed content, etc.).\nA high amount of advertisements  -  especially above the fold.\nLittle or no quality inbound links or social signals.\nAnything else that would signal a spammy site.\nTo recover from a \"Panda Slap\" all one needed to do was make the visitor's experience on a site a better one - whether it was by removing low quality content or by taking steps to speed up your site. Though many loathed the update at the time, Panda has certainly made the web a better place and has since been updated (at the time of writing) 20 times, with the last one focusing on devaluing many exact match domains (EMDs).\nPenguin\nThe most recent major algorithm change by Google, released earlier this year on April 24th, is one that focuses more on illegitimate link building - a practice which, until this update, many were engaged in. Like Panda, there are a set of things that the algorithm update looks for which may either reward or penalize a site. With Penguin, it is anything that signals and unnatural link profile. This includes:\nA high percentage of exact match anchor text links.\nA low percentage of branded links.\nA high percentage of links outside your niche.\nLinks from sites that are deemed \"spammy\" by Google.\nA high percentage of comment links.\nAnything that seems \"unnatural.\"\nA recovery from a \"Penguin Slap\" has proven to be a bit more difficult than a Panda recovery - mainly because it involved dealing with sites other than your own. Not only did many webmasters have to reach out to spammy sites to get links to their site removed (which, ironically, many had to pay for), but they needed to dump resources into the creation of natural links in order to even out the link profile. In case a \"natural\" link profile is unclear, here is what Google is looking for:\nHigh quality links from a diverse assortment of domains within your niche.\nMany social signals from Twitter, Facebook, etc.\nLink type diversity  -  with many having branded or universal anchor text.\nDeep links.\nAny other links that help contribute to what a natural link profile would consist of.\nSo there you have it, Google's most recent algorithm changes in a nutshell.\nSo how does Zemanta fit into all of this? Are we really a product that abides by all of Google's rules? Even the most recent updates? Though it may come as no surprise that our answer is yes, there are several reasons for that - related to both Panda and Penguin.\nNow of course you can use Zemanta to add related articles, images and tags to your blog post. But if a user wants to get the most out of Zemanta, then they will have added their blog to our index so that when they link to other bloggers using our tool, we will then go ahead and recommend their content to other bloggers that are writing about similar content. This, of course, is a practice known as \"Link Love.\"\nLink Love  -  Why is Linking Out Good For You from Zemanta.\nSounds like a great way to earn links, right? Well yes, but there are a few catches - all of which work very nicely with Google's algorithmic animals.\nFirst, let it be known that we have a dedicated team focused on keeping all spammy and low quality blogs out of our index. Doing this not only ensures that our tool isn't abused by spammers, but it also provides incentive for bloggers that have the potential to create high quality original content.\nBut getting into our index is only the first step. If a blogger has any hopes of getting linked to by other Zemanta bloggers, they have to continue creating high quality original content that other bloggers choose to link to - among the many other relevant articles of similar quality that we suggest to them. This not only creates a competitive environment where only the most quality content survives, but it also creates a better web. A web that Google is also trying to create.\nNot only does Zemanta force serious bloggers to create quality content on a quality site (a la Panda), but it also offers them an opportunity to receive a diverse set of natural, deep links from other quality bloggers within their niche (as per Penguin). Is there anything that we missed?\nThe post Why Zemanta and Google Get Along So Well appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Why Zemanta and Google Get Along So Well"}, {"body": "How many times have you heard an argument about what the next killer app should be for the iPad?\nWell, this phase seems to be coming to an end, and yes, we are moving into a period of delivering something more meaningful for the users. The value of a modern storytelling technique is bundled into a new buzzword, transmedia.\nWhat is Transmedia?\nTransmedia is a storytelling technique, which happens across multiple media platforms, but in a platform appropriate way.\nContent is spread across several media simultaneously. It's not just about digital media, but also a combination of several traditional channels or a combination of both, such as the environment, radio, TV, web, mobile, etc.\n3 Main Phases of Development\nBut what does this mean in practice? We can divide transmedia development process in 3 main phases: concept development, distribution and growth. Each phase is characterized by emotional investment, social mechanics, participation and care.\n1. Transmedia concept development: Emotional investment\nDuring the concept development process, you need to answer 3 basic questions:\nWhat is the story I want to tell?\nWhat is the best way to tell the story?\nWhy should anyone care?\nWhile designing for transmedia have in mind that the story evolves and spreads when people feel connected.\nContent Triggers (Source: by Reuben Halper, Advertising Program Manager  -  Google/Youtube)\n2. Distribution Models: Social mechanics\nDistribution models are rapidly changing, challenging designers and strategists on how things are made, distributed and consumed.\nBy building engaging stories, we always take people somewhere else, exploring new ways of how to earn and keep attention. We drive them from a platform to platform to consume our story; but we don't let them be passive.\nWhile designing the distribution strategy, the main questions you have to answer are:\nHow will I deliver the story?\nWhat kind of user participation do I want to achieve?\nSocial mechanics can be predesigned by answering the following questions:\nWhy should anyone pay attention to my story?\nWhy should anyone care?\nWhy should they share?\nWhy should they return?\n3. Growth: Participation and Care\nStart by considering audience's behavior, but don't apply rules; let information become your intuition.\nTransmedia Storytelling in Practice\n1. Building Storyworlds, the art, craft & biz of storytelling in the 21st Century\nBuilding Storyworlds is a book about the process and design theory of how we build immersive storytelling experiences, written by Lance Weiler, the pioneer of transmedia thinking and practice.\n\"Using the limitations of Twitter, each page of this book was written in 140 characters or less. This theme is then carried further as the book will be published in a limited edition 140-copy run. An experiment in scarcity and abundance, each page of the book says 'set this book free please retweet',\" says Weiler. So it isn't surprising that the book costs $140.\n2. Classical train: Enjoy the music\nImagine entering a train and being treated with one of the most beautiful rides of your life.\nCopenhagen Philharmonic performed Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt on a crowded metro train. It just goes to prove that classical music doesn't have to be played in concert halls or only be enjoyed by a limited group of people. They brought music back to the streets and vice versa, from streets back into the theatre using public space, radio and web as channels of concept distribution.\n3. The Spiral\nThe Spiral is a five-episode participative TV series that challenges users and centers them on the search for the six stolen paintings.\n\"Arturo is a mysterious and enigmatic Banksy-like artist known in the art scene for his playful actions against the establishment. He runs The Warehouse, an art community in Copenhagen. Together with six young artists from The Warehouse, he sets up a major stunt: the heist of six major works of art. Arturo and the artists invite the audience to search and find the paintings to create The Spiral, the most valuable work of art.\"\nThe Spiral was broadcast in September 2012 across Europe. The story could be experienced on TV, online and offline.\n4. Antigones Dagbok, mobile drama\nKista Teater is a mobile theater that uses technology as a tool to share stories and create a deeper dialogue between people. It brings theater plays closer to the audience through the use of a mobile phone. Participation and the use of the public space are adapted to the standard use of phone, as an object of communication.\nTickets for the Kista Theater plays can be bought via web or text messaging.\nThe examples above present different transmedia approaches and models. Hope they inspire you in a way to step out of your frame and create something more meaningful for us, the users. But remember, without a good story you have nothing to communicate.\nThe post Transmedia Storytelling Cookbook: from Digital to a Multiplatform Approach appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Transmedia Storytelling Cookbook: from Digital to a Multiplatform Approach"}, {"body": "That's how it starts\nWe go back to your house\nWe check the charts\nAnd start to figure it out\nAfter studying abroad in Copenhagen by chance for a semester in 2006, I got a real itch to see more of the world and experience what it has to offer. I became obsessed with the concept that there were actually people living in farther reaches of this planet than I could imagine, and getting by just fine without the \"comforts\" of whatever I've been accustomed to for my first twenty-something years of life.\nAnd if it's crowded all the better,\nBecause you know we're gonna be up late\nAnd if you're worried about the weather\nThen you picked the wrong place to stay\nThat's how it starts\nAt that time my responsible instincts took over and told me \"Birthday or not, don't go with Paco\". So I returned to Washington, DC in mid-2006 to finish up my senior year of college. Then there was a masters program. Then there was a job. And a girl. And New York, the city I'd wanted to live in for my whole life. And an apartment with two of my best friends who I hadn't spent much time with since high school. And yet somehow, everything I'd always wanted wasn't enough. For years now I'd dreamt about traveling Europe, speaking in foreign tongues, eating local cuisines, seeing the sun rise and set in places I could only dream of, and interacting with (and becoming one of) the locals. Would this ever come to fruition? Well, I already spoiled that answer for you above, so yes, but what made it so?\nAnd so it starts\nYou switch the engine on\nWe set controls for the heart of the sun\nOne of the ways that we show our age\nWell, things change, people change, hairstyles change, interest rates fluctuate... Things ended with the girl, the job came to an end, and after a deep conversation during a mans weekend I realized that simply talking about what you want in life isn't good enough  -  you have to put the wheels into motion yourself and start taking actual steps towards your goals or you will never realize them. Actions speak louder than words. So I set my full sights on moving to Europe. I moved home to my aunt and uncle's house in Long Island, played the commuting game for a while, tried to go to fewer concerts, and saved some money. I scoured the internet looking for work  -  in Paris, in Barcelona, anywhere really. Then FINALLY, through a contact in the New York Tech Meetup listserve I became in touch with Bostjan, which led to Skype interviews with Andraz Tori, Dusan Omercevic, Marko Mrdjenovic and a few others on the Zemanta team at that time, and before I knew it I was on a plane bound for Ljubljana, Slovenia via Munich. It was that easy!\nYou spent the first five years trying to get with the plan\nAnd the next five years trying to be with your friends again\nOK, so it wasn't THAT easy. After the first job ended, I ended up getting a sweet new one somewhere else. I ended up meeting another girl. My interviews at Zemanta went semi-ok, as I'd been away from true CS problems for a few years  -  the bottom line is that I think they took a big chance on me and I want to say here and now that I am truly grateful. Sure, me moving from the New York startup community to the Ljubljana, Slovenia startup community is me taking a big chance on them too, but they're the ones who made my European dream possible in the first place. On top of all of this, my cousin Nathaniel had plans to get married in late January, around the time I'd intended to go, but I wasn't deterred. I postponed my potential move date and made a concrete plan.\nIt comes apart\nThe way it does in bad films\nExcept the part\nWhere the moral kicks in\nI told my sweet new job that I was leaving. I spent time with my family. I went to the first wedding of my generation of my family and ate one of the best breakfasts of my life, surrounded by the people that I love the most in this world. I asked the new woman to move to Europe with me. She said yes. We made plans for her to join me in Slovenia a few months after I'd arrived there, and the rest would fall into place. I booked a ticket and headed for Europe. \u0160krat picked me up from the airport on that grey Slovenian winter day (one of the first of many logistics that he helped me with over the last two years, for which I am truly grateful) and so began what I'd been dreaming about for years.\nI wouldn't trade one stupid decision\nFor another five years of life\nSo, what did I want out of this experience?\nI wanted to move somewhere new where I could experience new and foreign traditions and language. I wanted to learn and experience firsthand a culture and heritage of a people that I didn't already know. I wanted to travel. I wanted to see a cycling race. I wanted to get into shape. I wanted to read. I wanted to cook. I wanted to drink outside. I wanted to see the sun rise and set in foreign lands. I wanted to make local friends. I wanted to live without the comforts of things that I was used to for the first 26 years of my life, and I didn't want to have a concrete return date. And after everything, I wanted to know myself and the place that I had come from better.\nYou drop the first ten years just as fast as you can\nAnd the next ten people who are trying to be polite\nWhen you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France\nYeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?\nSo I got weird.\nI moved out of my comfort zone, to a magical place called Slovenia. A fairytale city with dragons and castles. I took Slovenian lessons. I drank coffee. I drank red beer and green beer. I celebrated Pust (Slovenian Carnival, kind of like Halloween) in Cerknica. I went to local web meetups and even spoke at some of them. I spoke at the university. I read books (yes more than one!). I spent time hacking together side projects into the wee hours of the night. Some things I finished, some things I didn't. I made friends. Lots of them. I joined a band and had a bunch of gigs. I bought soap/shampoo/deodorant at the local shops. I shopped for fresh produce at the local market weekly and cooked most nights of the week, learning to make many new dishes along the way. I got in shape  -  I completed the Rapha Rising Challenge, successfully climbing 6881 meters on my bike in the span of a week. I spent ten days traveling around the Croatian islands with my phone off. I swam in the Mediterranean. I ate fresh fish. I slept on the deck of an overnight ferry under the stars. I watched the sun set and I watched it rise again. I drank more coffee. I hiked. I went cycling, swimming, canoeing, paintballing, and canyoning. I ate well and I slept well. I wore slippers. I ate Chinese food, Thai food, and sushi. I ate octopus, squid, lobster, crab, and shrimp. I drank wine from a variety of excellent European wine regions. I saw many of the major European capitals. I spoke Slovenian, Italian, Dutch, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, French, Danish, German and Czech. I paid with Euro, Kuna, Tolar, Koruna, Pound, and Kroner. I flew in planes. I rode trains and looked out the window. I drove cars (and go karts). I looked out over the sea from ferry boats. I ate Christmas dinner. I spent New Years Eve dodging fireworks and drinking champagne, beer, and mulled wine. I drank wine in the hills of several Italian wineries. I saw some of the best cyclists in the world race over the Poggio in the Milano-San Remo cycling race. I went to the Berlin Buzzwords conference. I reconnected with old friends and saw ghosts from a former life in Copenhagen. I hosted two passover seders. I drank homemade schnapps, rakija, and medica (not all at once). I went to Oktoberfest. I stayed in a bar after it closed with locals in Budapest. I saw all of the craziness surrounding the royal wedding in person. I experienced a surprise wedding reception for two really good friends. I experienced the bright morning sun after many nights in Metelkova. I ate at Nobel Burek. I celebrated the Jewish high holidays in Vienna, Ljubljana, and Trieste. I DJd. I snuck into the music school and played piano. I drank on the streets. I went snowboarding in Slovenia, Austria, and Italy. I went dog sledding. I lost my favorite hat. I gave away my second favorite hat. I shaved my head (twice). I left something behind.\nI traveled to Bled (Slovenia), Groningen, IKEA in Italy, Zagreb (Croatia), London, Birmingham (England), Ferrara (Italy), Venice, Piran (Slovenia), Florence, Bled (again), Trieste (Italy), Vienna, \u0160marna Gora (Slovenia), Koper (Slovenia), Vienna (again), Piran (again), The \u0160kocjan Caves (Slovenia), Lipica (Slovenia), Trieste (again), Trnfest (Trnovo, Ljubljana), Rijeka (Croatia), Cres (Croatia), back to Rijeka, Hvar (Croatia), Split (Croatia), Bohinj (Slovenia), Piran (again, this time with the boys for a man's trip), Paris, New York City, Boston, Ljubljana, Venice (again), Paris (again), Prague (New Years Eve), Heiligenblut (Austria), Kranjska Gora (Slovenia), Dog Sledding Somewhere In Italy, Krvavec (Slovenia), Heiligenblut (again), Vienna (again), Kranj (Slovenia), Podpec/Preserje (Slovenia), Milano/Alba/Asti/San Remo/Porto Fino (Italy) with Jones and the boys, Turjak (Slovenia), FRI (CS University) Ljubljana, Slovenia, Budapest, Cinque Terra (Italy), Sto\u017eice (Ljubljana, Slovenia), Koper (again), Krk (Croatia), Barcelona, Berlin, Copenhagen, Trieste (again), Velika Planina (Slovenia), Krk (again), To\u0161ko celo (Slovenia), Orle (Slovenia), Javor (Slovenia), Prezganje (Slovenia), Dubrovnik (Croatia), Piran (again), Maribor (Slovenia), Vintgar Gorge (Slovenia), Plitvice Lakes (Croatia), Povile (Croatia), Postojna Caves (Slovenia), and Munich (Oktoberfest, Germany) among other places that I didn't take pictures of and/or forgot to mention.\nI saw Dum Dum Girls, Aloe Blacc, Mulatu Astatke, Sufjan Stevens, Arrested Development (yes THAT Arrested Development!), Xiu Xiu, Slovenia vs. Belgium (soccer), Cara Beth Satalino, Balmorhea, Fleet Foxes, USA vs. Slovenia (soccer), Elton John, Damir Advi?, some Kung Fu thing at Hala Tivoli, Lambchop, Tune Yards, Des Ark, Nils Frahm, Shearwater, Ljubljana vs. Austria (hockey), Ronan Marquet, DJ Tanja, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Julia Holter, some Croatian surf rock band, Sigur Ros, Japandroids, Damir Advic (again), and countless other shows and events that I also either didn't take pictures of, forgot to label the pictures of, and/or forgot to mention.\nTo tell the truth, this could be the last time\nSo here we go, like a sail's force into the night\nAnd if I made a fool, if I made a fool, if I made a fool\nOn the road, there's always this\nAnd if I'm sewn into submission\nI could still come home to this\nAnd now the tough part. How/when/why did we decide that this adventure was over (for now) and what did that mean?\nI think that we both knew in the back of our minds somewhere that we'd move back to the States at some point. Part of the allure of this experience for me was that it was a one way ticket until I decided otherwise, but at some point I think I knew that I would decide otherwise.\nMy mom had been over to visit the first summer, and Brooke's brother and mom spent Christmas with us, but the reality is that both of our families are much larger than that, and we're very close to them. We've got cousins and aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews who we love dearly, and despite what the world has to offer, being close to the people you love offers infinitely more.\nLjubljana is an amazing place, and will always be a large part of both mine and Brooke's lives. When we started talking about moving back and being near our families, we had a discussion over a drink on our balcony and said that if it weren't for our families not being there, we could probably go on living that life forever. The pace of life was good. We were happy. We had friends. What more could we want? But the reality of the situation was that our families were far away, and we wanted to be closer.\nSo we announced that we were moving back to New York, which was surprisingly one of the harder things I've ever had to do. It was like breaking up with a girl  -  you know it's for the best and you don't mean to offend, but you also care about the other person and are worried about how they will take it. I definitely got a little verklempt when telling my coworkers, my band mates, and my friends, and I think Brooke did as well. It was almost as if I couldn't make the words come out. Following the realization that we were actually leaving, and our final European travels (this time around), #TheLastTime got stretched out into a series of parties (planned and unplanned), a farewell gig for my band, the selling and giving away of most of our household things, lots of emotion, lots of hugs, and lots of drinking. When Brooke and I talked about it later and looked back on those last few weeks, we were really humbled by what we experienced and felt. Not only did we get to see Europe, get to work at two awesome companies with great coworkers, and have some of the best experiences of our lives, but we also made some amazing friends along the way who truly care about us.\nI've said it before and I'll say it again, thank you guys for all of this. Thank you for letting us into your culture and for helping us to experience what we did. It means the world to both of us.\nAnd with a face like a dad and a laughable stand\nYou can sleep on the plane or review what you said\nWhen you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tan\nYou think over and over, \"hey, I'm finally dead\"\nOh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand\nYou look contorted on yourself, you ridiculous prop\nYou forget what you meant when you read what you said\nAnd yeah we knew you were tired, but then,\nWhere are your friends tonight?\nSo, did I get what I wanted out of the experience?\nIn the end did I do all of the things that I wanted to do? Yes.\nDid I get everything out of this experience I possibly could have? Yes.\nDo I have any regrets? No.\nWhere are your friends tonight?\nWhere are your friends tonight?\nIf I could see all my friends tonight\nIf I could see all my friends tonight\nIf I could see all my friends tonight\nIf I could see all my friends tonight\nWhy did we move back to New York? To be near our families (and to start on the next great adventure, duh!)\nWhere are our friends tonight?

It's a very popular word, especially if you talk or write about content marketing. I started questioning in my mind what exactly \"engagement\" means. Am I the only one who doesn't get it? And I was thinking and reading and thinking...\nLo and behold, a few days ago Marcus Sheridan of the Sales Lion, wrote an article about engagement, asking his readers \"How do you define 'engagement' and 'interaction' within your company's marketing campaign?\"\nI was a speaker at this year's Content Marketing World in Columbus, Ohio. I gave a presentation on why your content marketing strategy should also include print. During the conference I had a great conversation with Michele Linn, editorial director at Content Marketing Institute (CMI). You may remember an interview we had with her for Zemanta blog.  She advised me to write a post based on my presentation. What an excellent advice! And I started to think about it. But in the meantime I constantly postponed writing due to other priorities.\nLo and behold, a few days ago, Joe Pulizzi of CMI wrote an article 7 Reasons to Consider Print for Your 'Non-Traditional' Content Strategy.\nAn Idea Isn't Enough\nNow, I could think that I am as great as Marcus and Joe; we seem to think about the same issues in a similar manner. Or I could think, wow, they stole an idea for writing from me. Or whatever.\nBut none of it matters, because I didn't do it. They did.\nHaving an idea means absolutely nothing if you don't do anything about it.\nAnd we're back to what I wrote about half a year ago  -  how to snap out of the perfectionist state and be more productive (analytics and sharing of this article tell me I wasn't alone in this). We live in a really fast-paced world. There are more than 181 million blogs. So you have to react fast. Be the first. We don't live in the 18th or 19th centuries any more when you could take as much time as you needed to write classic works on a particular topic.\n5 Things to Avoid\nSnap out of your perfectionist state and just do it! Keeping a great idea or question in your head won't do anybody any good. So avoid the following:\nKeeping your thoughts on a subject in your head for too long.\nWaiting for a great idea. If something bothers you, it sure bothers someone else too.\nIgnoring your customers/readers' questions. Marcus Sheridan says, write an answer in a form of blog post. I say, do it ASAP.\nNot writing daily. It's like going to the gym. It should become part of your daily life no matter what.\nGiving up because somebody else wrote about it. Just because Marcus and Joe wrote about the subjects I was thinking about, it doesn't mean they were the first or that no one else can write about them. React! Maybe your view is different. What can you add to the conversation? Start writing now while it's still hot!\nThe post What Are You Waiting For? Just Do It Already! appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "What Are You Waiting For? Just Do It Already!"}, {"body": "Image Credit: G.K. Chesterton, By Herbert Lambert (National Portrait Gallery)\n[Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons\nHe was born in 1874. He was fat, unattractive, disheveled and absent-minded. His ideas were dismissed and often ridiculed by many of the era's most exalted men and women of letters, science and state. Nevertheless he remained popular with peers and the public during his lifetime, and his ideas are every bit as relevant and provocative today as they were 100 years ago.\nHis name was Gilbert Keith Chesterton, and he was one of the most prolific, and in my judgment one of the finest, writers of his day or any other day.\nG. K. Chesterton was a leading journalist of the early 20th century. An Englishman, he wrote about everything under the sun: politics, religion, history, philosophy, literature, culture and economics were among his favorite topics. He wrote voluminously: novels, short stories, poems, plays, essays and Christian apologetics. In addition to all of this, he was an active and sought-after public speaker whose debates with George Bernard Shaw attracted worldwide interest.\nChesterton was popular in large part because he was controversial. He attacked communism and socialism at the very time these ideologies were picking up steam. He attacked capitalism and predicted its downfall while it was basking in its glory. He was a convert to Catholicism in an Anglican society that was rapidly becoming secularized, and a man who respected history at a time when the culture was in rebellion against it.\nWhat does all this have to do with blogging?\nToday we live in a world that is not all that different from Chesterton's. We are confronted with problematic and contentious issues everywhere, issues which seem unresolvable.  Just as then, dark clouds hang over our heads, even though one man's cloud is another man's sun.\nHowever, one thing that is different today is that we seem to have lost our ability to discuss contentious issues with civility, and with the purpose of finding common ground and solutions.  It is in this area that I think we can learn from Chesterton, because he had the ability to tackle tough issues head-on, make his case with complete conviction, and yet still hold the respect of his opponents and continue to engage them.\nAny blogger seeking to argue his/her case runs the risk of offending, alienating, or enraging. In fact, for some bloggers these risks have turned into objectives; for them blogging has become a purposeful attempt to provoke rather than to persuade. This is not good. When debate sinks to the level of shouting matches, when intimidation rather than illumination becomes the strategy of choice, our problems can only get worse. As Chesterton himself put it, \"people generally quarrel because they cannot argue.\"\nHow did Chesterton make his case in a way that promoted debate rather than stifle it? Here are a few instructive quotes that will help show us the way.\n1. Humor\n\"Without education, we are in a horrible and deadly danger of  taking educated people seriously.\"\n2. Penetrating Insight\n\"What embitters the world is not excess of criticism, but absence of self-criticism.\"\n3. Reframing the Issue\n\"The test of a democracy is not whether the people vote, but whether the people rule.\"\n4. Uplifting Point of View\n\"There are some people, nevertheless  -  and I am one of them  -  who think that the most practical and important thing about a man is still his view of the universe.\"\n5. Finding the Center\n\"Briefly, then, we dismiss the two opposite dangers of bigotry and fanaticism, bigotry which is a too great vagueness and fanaticism which is a too great concentration.\"\n6. Putting Opponents in a Positive Light\n\"The modern world is not evil; in some ways the modern world is far too good. It is full of wild and wasted virtues.\"\n7. Identifying Yourself with Your Opponents\n\"Somewhere about the beginning of the nineteenth century, we English came to the conclusion that we could not think.\"\n8. Focusing on the Big Picture\n\"In the darkness of barbarism men knew the truth without the facts. In the twilight of half-civilization, they saw the truth illuminating the facts. In the full blaze and radiance of complete civilization they found all the facts and lost the truth forever.\"\nBloggers writing about controversial topics would be well served by reading Chesterton in detail.\nMy feeble attempts to convey his style and sensibilities fall far short of what can be learned by going to the source.\nStirring up emotions with incendiary attacks may result in a lot of page views and social shares, but it's a strategy that lacks staying power and is next to worthless as a means of persuasion.\nChesterton set his sights much higher. Consequently, he is still opening minds and changing them 77 years after his death. As bloggers, we should all be asking ourselves, how high am I willing to reach?\nThe post 8 100-year-old tips for writing about controversial topics appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "8 100-year-old tips for writing about controversial topics"}, {"body": "The 10 Types of Social Media Addicts [INFOGRAPHIC]\nAn infographic that illustrates the ten most common social media fiends.

Despite the stratospheric amount of knowledge and information on the Internet, plug-ins, such as Zemanta, make bloggers' lives easier. They also help share the love  -  post a link to sites or blogs, usually unsolicited, that you enjoy, admire, or find useful. All this is necessary to make yourself and your blog visible, to be read by the majority of your target audience.\nSemantically advanced In-text Links\nZemanta widget also includes an in-text links that helps you leverage the insurmountable quantity of knowledge saved online; this isn't commercial content, but informational content.\nWhen you employ an in-text link in your text, you selflessly give your readers an opportunity to further look into a phrase or an issue at an outside source. This means a more interactive experience on your blog  -  an added value.\nMoreover, in-text links has been semantically well developed.\nThis means that it can recognize the meaning of a word and distinguish different meanings correctly. For example, the program recognizes the difference between Apple and an apple and can identify the correct meaning of the word, whether it means a company or a fruit.\nZemanta in-text engine is familiar with more than 32 million synonyms and can differentiate almost 7 million meanings.\nHow to use it\nYou can already choose among many links where you can direct your readers like Wikipedia, Last.fm, Amazon, MusicBrainz, CrunchBase, Google Finance and many more. Unesco World Heritage List is Zemanta's recent addition.\nLet's look at an example (see the bottom pic).\nYou're writing a post in your dashboard. Your post includes a name of the site that is on the Unesco World Heritage List  -  Wadi Rum, for example.\nBelow the main box on the dashboard you'll see In-text Links box that suggests further links to outside sources with more detailed information on the keyword/subject.\nClick on the selected one and a link will be automatically added to a specific word or phrase in your text.\nSimple as that. Fast as it sounds.\nThe post New Addition to Zemanta In-text Links appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "New Addition to Zemanta In-text Links"}, {"body": "Illustration by Zemanta\nThe reason people are \"rewriting\" the same thing over and over again is simple  -  the web is no longer perceived as a global library, a collection of knowledge which overflows national and continental borders but has taken a turn for a walled gardens approach, where every community nominates its own librarian who takes care of them. How and why did this happen?\nWe like it closed\nWe build the walls ourselves. There was no outer entity that did this. We did this by moving our social network of skilled people online. We did this by connecting the dots, by enabling our network of highly skilled friends online.\nThis approach is working, for us. We know the authors, we know their background, we know where to find them if we want to have a beer... er... additional information. We get the complete package.\nInformation has gone social. Call it a socialation.\nSearch engines are trying to keep up. And they suck at that.\nThey suck at connecting the same dots we connected.\nThey suck at recognizing our needs and our primary sources of satisfaction.\nFor most search engines (ol' mighty Google included) the web is still a vast limitless space where information is floating around freely and without strings. Where information has no name-tag.\nSearch engines don't know if the information is written by a ten-year old hack or a fifty-year old scientist. The word \"relevance\" is thrown around way too much these days and as famous Inigo Montoya would says: \"You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.\"\nThe machine basically only knows if a certain piece of information is shared a lot, commented upon a lot or linked to a lot. The machine looks at the content and counts the phrases appearing in that content. Then it decides that the relevance is the same as high density of a certain phrase. Which tells you absolutely nothing about the relevance. The machine doesn't know. And it sucks at guessing.\nDeath of the machine(?)\nThat does not mean the machine is dead. Far from it. The machine knows our networks are not limitless. The machine knows the Dunbar number. The machine knows we need it. It knows that we want to keep some information out of our social circle.\nIt knows that you would rather die than ask your friend about that pimple on your butt (seriously, you should get that checked). And it knows we sometimes require clean, anonymous and private information.\nSo the machine does what it knows best: serving our pages and pages of hits and shits, of information bits from all over the world, where we can consume and process vast quantites of information. Written by the people for the people (and search engines (and bots (and link farms (and other entities)))). We query, it delivers. We think, it does. We ponder, it answers. Sort of.\nThe machine isn't dead because it knows that there are smart people out there who don't want to join our social circle (why won't you write back, Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson???). Because it knows that we do not know everything. And that sometimes our friends are pretty clueless as well.\nViva la Socialation!\nSo remember this text the next time you are browsing the web, filtering out the useless hits on your favourite search engin that got there because somebody thought he knows everything about screwing a lightbulb. Remember that people are the best source of information and that the best way to get new info is to recognize a good source and just ask it.\nThe post Search Engines Can't Keep up with Socialation appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Search Engines Can't Keep up with Socialation"}, {"body": "This announcement comes from a now typical Matt Cutts video (found below) and shortly after, their Webmaster Central Blog. With the announcement comes a hefty share of warnings and disclaimers about how most webmasters will not need to use this tool and how it should not be used at all by anyone below an \"advanced\" webmaster level.\nDespite the advanced webmaster label, the tool itself is quite easy to use and Matt even outlines the steps that should be taken in order to use the tool appropriately. The first step, he mentions, is to identify all of the links that may be viewed as low quality, spammy, or anything that may penalize the site under Penguin. Then, after all other link removal tools/practices are exhausted, simply upload a text file which includes the location of each bad link. The process is so simple that it is no surprise that Google is worried that this will be abused by inexperienced webmasters.\nSome of the standardized formats and other limitations of the disavow links tool:\n- There should only be one url per line.\n- To disavow an entire domain, simply add \"domain: www.spammydomain.com\".\n- To insert any notes (for either the web team or Google) just add a \"#\" at the beginning of the line.\n- There is only one text file per website. To update which links should be disavowed, download the existing text file and then upload it with any requested changes.\n- There is a 2 mb maximum file size.\n- It may take a few weeks for Google to review the file and disavow the links.\n- There is the option to \"re-avow\" a link, but it is warned that this will take even longer than it did to disavow it and it may have a lower value when the process is complete.\nThough many think that jury is still out when it comes to how much negative SEO or spammy backlinks really effect a website, this is definitely a step in the right direction to confirm a lot of speculation. And yes, although many sites are going to use this tool when they don't need to, it is godsend for a lot of websites that were ruined by low quality backlinks that were acquired years ago by previously effective link-building schemes.\nThe post Introducing: Google's Disavow Links Tool appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Introducing: Google's Disavow Links Tool"}, {"body": "According to Mirror, nearly \"7.3 million viewers were watching as Baumgartner sat on the edge of the capsule, moments before the jump\" on YouTube. Moreover, after he landed \"Red Bull posted a picture of the daredevil on his knees to Facebook. In less than 40 minutes, the picture was shared more than 29,000 times and generated nearly 216,000 likes and more than 10,000 comments\". A tremendous day for science, Felix, Red Bull, and social media.\nHere are four blogging lessons that corporate bloggers can learn from yesterday's record breaking jump.\n1. Do Not Rush, Plan Carefully\nThe skydive was patiently planned for 5 years. Nothing was left to chance.\nLESSON: don't rush into anything. Just because you have an idea or somebody whispers it into your ears, it doesn't mean you must do it the very next day or month or even year. Think about it carefully, plan in details, so when you're ready to launch your business blog, you WILL BE ready. Be patient! In the end, it'll be worth your time.\n2. Build Clear Structure\nDuring the entire flight up and almost 10-minute jump, the only voice Felix heard was of his predecessor and confidante Joe Kittinger. This was done deliberately; Felix wanted to exclude any communication noise and misunderstandings.\nLESSON: Build a clear communication structure within your company. Make it clear who's responsible for your corporate blog and what his/her/their exact responsibilities are. Is it clear where and who you can get content from for your blog?\nA clearly defined communications structure is crucial in small and even more so in bigger organizations, otherwise your blog can turn into a total mess.\n3. Checklist\nIf you watched the Felix skydive from the edge of space, you might have noticed a checklist of steps that needed to be performed as written. They looked like three big pieces of paper with instructions.\nLESSON: For your blog to be effective, you must know every single necessary step: before, during, and after  -  that is what to do when planning content ahead, how to write and edit posts, and what to do after an article is posted on your blog. Checklists are a great and very helpful tool, so you don't forget anything. Believe me, you will not regret the time you spend putting together a check list.\n4. Transparency is Key\nWe all had access to the record breaking skydive. Millions of people listened to every word Joe and Felix said during the entire time, we even watched them thanks to all the cameras. They didn't hide anything. Just moments before the jump, we all heard Felix say: \"This is very serious, Joe.\" As Baumgartner went through last-minute checks inside the capsule, it was found that a heater for his visor was not working. This meant the visor fogged up as he exhaled. And he sincerely and openly expressed worry about this.\nLESSON: Bloggers, especially those who blog for business, should always be 100% sincere. Be genuine. Don't hide, or even worse, lie. Self-censorship has no place in blogging! You have to catch hearts and minds of your target audience in an honest and open way.\nThe post 4 Crucial Blogging Lessons from Felix Baumgartner's Skydive from the Edge of Space appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "4 Crucial Blogging Lessons from Felix Baumgartner's Skydive from the Edge of Space"}, {"body": "Feature Friday: Zemanta Thumbnails\nI have used Zemanta's recommended links service on my blog for something like four or five years now.

All of the major blogs that cover blogging have had their chance to add their two cents as to what the essentials of guest blogging are, how you can get actual results from guest blogging, how to manage guest bloggers once you have them, or even why guest blogging is a bubble.\nNo matter what your opinions on guest blogging, it's hard to deny its popularity and was really only a matter of time until Google took a stance on it. That is why everyone's favorite Google engineer, Matt Cutts, recently released a three minute video on how Google is currently viewing guest blogging:\nSo there you have it, Google's stance on guest blogging.\nThey are perfectly fine with counting the links if they are from guest blog posts that are above the \"minimum to get by,\" the content is original and if the guest blogger put a lot of time and effort into creating the blog post. Oh, and bonus points if the guest blog posts are from \"high quality people.\" Naturally, the question arises on how Google is going to possibly keep track of this, a point so eloquently brought up by the current top YouTube comment:\nI do see the point that Google is making, if guest blogging trends the way article directories did, they could have a bit of a situation on their hands. Especially for those who manage to bypass any duplicate content penalties via blog post spinning.

He writes:\nA mission statement is a company's reason for existence. It's why the organization does what it does. Southwest Airlines' mission statement has always been to democratize the travel experience. The mission statement for CVS is to be the easiest pharmacy retailer for customers to use. So, in simple terms, the mission statement must answer the question, Why do we exist?\nWhat a mission statement isn't\nJoe goes on to give an example of Inc. magazine's About Us: \"Welcome to Inc.com, the place where entrepreneurs and business owners can find useful information, advice, insights, resources and inspiration for running and growing their businesses.\"\nThis is an example of what I dread the most. All blogs and news sites should provide useful information and insights for their readers. It's their core business. Too many times I've seen a description of a magazine or blog or news site that goes something like this: \"We publish interesting information, reports from events and news.\"\nA mission statement is about WHY\nI don't think this is a mission statement. It's not even close to what Joe says in the beginning; it isn't an answer to the question WHY.\nAt this year's Content Marketing World, Jason Falls from Social Media Explorer was clear; figure out WHY you're blogging: \"Before you do something, ask WHY until you come to a measurable value proposition.\"\nTherefore, if you don't have your mission statement yet, I'd suggest that you sit down and figure out why you exist in the first place. Only then you'll be able to make consistent content, editing, and writing decisions.\nWhat is Zemanta's mission statement\nZemanta's core business isn't to create great content, but to to make blogging easier, faster and better. The latter are their reasons for existence. It is their answer to WHY. It is their solution to a problem.\nContent marketing mission statements should have three parts:\n1. Core audience target\n2. What will be delivered to the audience\n3. The outcome for the audience\nAll of the above should follow the mission statement, i.e. after you have the answer to WHY. This is only the next step that includes all other factors that have to be taken into account, such as what channels will be used, who will do the job, etc.\nI learned about WHY by working with some great visionaries and content marketing strategists side by side, as well as following others, like Joe. And now I know that we must always first answer the question WHY, which must not be mistaken for HOW and WHAT  -  a golden circle of content marketing.\nThe post Why Your Content Marketing Mission Statement Should Be About Why, Not What or How appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Why Your Content Marketing Mission Statement Should Be About Why, Not What or How"}, {"body": "We at Zemanta are pleased to announce that we will be sponsoring WordCamp Denver and will be in attendance at both WordCamp Denver and Buffalo.\nWordCamp Denver is a two day event that is taking place October 13th and 14th at the L2 Arts & Culture Center and is set to feature a number of events and guest speakers.

Is it any wonder, then, that most business websites are detached, uninspiring and mind-numbingly dull? A dash of humor, on the other hand, will make your website less detached, more inspiring, and anything but dull.\nAt its best, humor engages users.\nHumor versus Insult\nAt its best, humor engages users. But humor must be at its best, or it will misfire and literally blow up in your face.\nThat last sentence was a joke. Did you get it? If not, no worries: it's an example of how not to use humor in website copy. The rampant misuse of \"literally\" and \"figuratively\" gives professional writers a lot of laughs, but readers of this blog aren't necessarily writers.\nFor humor to be effective, it must amuse the reader as well as the writer. Things that are funny to you and your coworkers or peers may not make any sense at all to potential customers. Even worse, some inside jokes come at the expense of the customer, which is almost certain to send them off into the arms of a competitor.\nSo the first and indispensible lesson for using humor: know your audience. This presents a real challenge for outsourced copywriters. If you use an outside writer for your site content, be sure to coach him/her on where customers will see humor in your business or industry.\nRelevant versus Ridiculous\nAll this talk about customers brings up another key attribute of business humor, relevance. Jokes about the business world your customers live in make you look perceptive and connected. Thus, they help customers connect with you  -  and like you.\nOn the other hand, jokes about golf on a sheet metal fabricating website make you look like a nut job. Even if the jokes are funny, potential customers won't trust your hands with carbon steel laser cutting if they think your head is at the golf course.\nLack of relevance is a real danger with business humor, and the fear of coming off as inappropriate or unhinged is what causes many firms to avoid humor altogether. And indeed, customers must be able to see a connection between the humor and the business, or you are better off following the advice, when in doubt, leave the humor out.\n5 Quick Tips on how to add humor to your website:\nHumor isn't the main course; it's seasoning. Heaping helpings of humor will make readers vomit (figuratively).\nTo prevent humor from mingling with important information, place humorous design elements on the sidebars of page templates. For instance, many blogs feature a daily cartoon that gives readers a reason to come back.\nSpeaking of blogs, they make a great focal point for humor, because most readers expect them to be less stodgy than the main site.\nVideos are another wonderful way to convey humor, mainly because people can't resist watching them. Bonus tip: Keep them short.\nLet users provide the humor. I'll show you an example in a minute.\nHumor at Work: Big Ass Fans\nBig Ass Fans is one of my favorite companies, and it's all because of how they use humor on their site.\nTheir site has a \"Genius Not At Work\" page, which features a short video poking fun at the company name:\nThey also have a \"Kudos & Complaints\" section, which consists of \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\" reader feedback, along with company responses where appropriate. Here's an exchange that manages to touch on religion:\nNotice that the company violates some of the suggestions I made in this post. Big Ass is definitely inviting controversy ... but with a name like that, can you blame them?\nThere are two reasons why Big Ass Fans makes it work. First, they allow customers to do the talking; second, they make themselves the butt of customer comments and their own humorous content.\nBig Ass Fans is a large, successful manufacturer of industrial fans. They have used humor for many years to engage customers and improve brand awareness. If humor can work for them, maybe it can work for you.\nDo you use humor on your blog? Why? Tell us in the comments below.\nThe post How to Add Humor to Your Website appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "How to Add Humor to Your Website"}, {"body": "The core of Zemanta is a recommendation engine. With a single call to the API it can recommend everything from related articles and relevant images to interesting links for your text.\nOkay, it only does those three things ...\nStill, doing that requires data. Lots of data. Regularly following over 600,000 RSS feeds has already amassed about five million evergreen articles and a <full slave hard drive> of content every three months or so.\nMost of this happens on a single awesome machine.\nLooking from the stratosphere, the architecture appears simple:\nan aggregator downloads the internet\na frontend serves requests\nDownloading the internet\nAggregators and crawlers wrestle the grumpy old grizzly bear that is the internet. They're the riot shield making sure all other services in your over-engineered application are talking to a predictable resource.\nZemanta's aggregator works in two stages.\nA resolver takes any URL imaginable and translates it into a proper feed using a bunch of heuristics and even the good old looking into the HTML trick. Source suggestions mostly fly in from user preferences, but there's also a service stumbling around the internet in a drunken stupor and finding interesting things to look at.\nThe second stage is a bit trickier. This one needs to make sure websites don't crash.\nNot only does it have to say \"Whoa there website, you're a bit slow right now. I'll come back later\" it also needs to overcome the uncanny valley of web scraping, decide what would make a good thumbnail, figure out whether a website deserves to be put in something called a \"main bucket\", maybe this page is spam? ...\nAnd then you're still left with indexing all this data so you can look it up later. Quickly.\nQuite a task. No wonder MySQL was the best key-value store to do this.\nWait what?\nTurns out MySQL is not only fast, it's also pretty good at being a huge key-value store. As long as you don't need to run an ALTER TABLE  -  that takes about a week.\nDon't worry, all the modern bells and whistles are being used as well. The flip-side of Cassandra's eventual consistency being eventual inconsistency. But more about that some other time.\nIndexing\nMySQL and Cassandra are great at storing json blobs and such, but Zemanta needs full-text search. Now that there is a problem.\nLuckily it's a problem a lot of people have. This means there's an off-the-shelf solution in the form of Solr, a software beast  written in Java, running on top of Lucene, giving everyone the ability to perform quick full-text searching over thousands, even millions, of documents.\nI have no idea how it works.\nBut I understand enough to know  why complex queries could be a problem. A problem so big it sometimes takes seconds to solve. Unacceptable for everyone but the most patient clients.\nRealizing most of your lookups will be based on phrases picked out by entity extraction solves this problem. Extract your entities in the crawler stage, ask Solr to do some searching and cache the responses.\nMarvelous.\nThe frontend\nKiller suggestions, by maureen lunn\nAt this point we are sitting on a pile of constantly updating data, waiting for somebody, anybody, to issue an API request so we can delight them with our vast piles of knowledge.\nBut not so fast!\nA single machine might be enough to handle crawling, but it certainly won't handle everyone talking at the same time. Sprinkling a bit of simple rsync solr replication, some sysadmin-fu and a bit of amazon's EC2 makes the problem as good as solved.\nNext we are left with running Django behind Nginx to handle incoming requests, unpack the data and later making sure to respond with something the client can actually read.\nOcto takes over from here  -  he's the sort of process that can take a request, split it into many tiny requests and making sure all subprocesses complete their darn task in a timely and orderly fashion.\nThis is where the actual recommendations happen. First a rule based named entity recognition (NER) algorithm takes a shot at the input text. Its only problem is it can't really decide whether Albert Einsten is one or two names, which human users find kind of odd.\nTo make the suggestions more human-like Zemanta created something called WTD, a statistics based entity extractor that uses a huge accumulation of knowledge, the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm and a sprinkling of things I have no hope of understanding.\nAll I know is that it works.\nWrapping up\nAfter that it's up to Octo to collect suggestions from all the different recommenders  -  entity extraction, related articles, images ...  -  and packs them up into something Django can package into json and send off to the user.\nHopefully the user likes what they get!\nAnd I just noticed WTD recognised \"Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm\" as an entity. Colour me impressed, I was certain it wouldn't.\nYou should follow me on twitter here.\nThe post Downloading the internet with a single machine appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Downloading the internet with a single machine"}, {"body": "An overused content marketing mantra is, \"Think like a publisher.\"  Well, I say, \"Think and act like a newspaper/magazine editor.\" Therefore, you should start thinking of your blog as a niche news site.\nWe are a junkie society. Hence, we prefer websites that offer a seemingly endless variety and quantity of regularly updated relevant content. Ask yourself, why you regularly check news sites, such as TechCrunch, New York Times, The Guardian online, Huffington Post and many more.\nBlogs are among the most popular tactics by B2B marketers. According to the latest study on B2B content marketing by Content Marketing Institute and Marketing Profs, blogs are used by 65% of marketers. Only social media and article posting are more popular than blogs.\nMoreover, blogs are used much more frequently than the year before. They're especially popular at companies with 10  -  99 employees.\nTaking all of the above into consideration, there are several steps that you can take towards making your blog a leading news source in your niche:\nRecognizable visual identity\nYour company's visual identity should be recognizable in the visual identity of your blog.\nAt the same time make it look like an online magazine or newspaper. It should give an impression that fresh content is published regularly and that there is a lot of relevant content to browse through.\nRegularly published content\nMake sure to always publish at previously defined time. Train your readers to expect a new article at a particular time of the day/week. For extra articles, use them in a \"breaking news\" sense. The goal is for you to become a leading news source for your niche.\nWe expect constant flow of new or in-depth articles from magazine or news sites. The same applies to blogs. This doesn't mean you have to publish tons of new articles a day. Instead, decide what works best for you  -  staff and time-related  -  and publish as much as possible. One caveat: although the quantity seems to matter, be careful it doesn't trump the quality of your articles.\nBlog is a Newspaper\nEdit your blog and articles as a great newspaper editor would. Do not publish only op-eds and how-to articles, mix them with news-like articles and in-depth analyses. Once again, become a thought leader and news source in your niche.\nVariety of authors\nNewspapers and magazines feature a variety of authors. Many of them represent a particular newspaper. You know what to expect from them, what kind of article, what topics they cover, when they're usually published.\nAnd then there are guest authors, usually carefully selected to further establish the newspaper/magazine's credibility, even to introduce the medium to new readers they otherwise couldn't/wouldn't.\nThe same applies to blogs. Include as many authors as it's necessary and manageable. An author or a few of them can represent a particular category (section) on your blog. For example, Swizec is our best and most popular author on all things technical.\nIn addition, do not forget guest bloggers. They're a great and effective addition to your blog; select them carefully.\nClear editorial policy\nYour blog needs a great editor who makes sure articles follow the long-term marketing and communication strategy of your company, that they're consistent in tone and message, that they're readable and shareable, and that there's a regular flow of new articles  -  following the editorial calendar.\nWhat's your take on blogs as news sites? Is a corporate blog basically another name for a niche news site?\nThe post 5 Steps To Ensure Your Blog Is A Leading News Source In Your Niche appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "5 Steps To Ensure Your Blog Is A Leading News Source In Your Niche"}, {"body": "What is contextual content strategy? How can you bend spoons with the power of your mind? How can a tool like Zemanta help? The answers, of course, \"are complicated.\" Or are they?\nPresenting contextual content to expand the minds of your audience and shift the reality of your brand in the mind of others is similar to spoon bending\nSo what is contextual content strategy?\nIn short, it is a strategy that employs diverse media to encourage brain-based associative connections. Our brains thrive on learning, and learning comes from combining. From a marketing perspective, the goal is that this learning will result in brand retention and behavioral shifts.\nDaniel Eizans coined the phrase \"Contextual Content Strategy\" two years ago when he mused that content strategy might someday meld with neuropsychological study or neuroscientific discovery. In other words, mapping content to brain function. Eizans writes:\nI have always contended that true \"content strategy\" must look beyond the web and focus on how people learn and put information into context. I contend that that context should be brought down to the most specific of levels and appeal to individual brain functions.\nScience fiction, or science reality? Perhaps both. Eizans goes on to write:\nThis certainly isn't a new concept, but it does call to attention a different reason for carefully selecting a graphic, illustration or animatic in that the visuals, coupled with copy can create deeper meaning and create a higher level of contextual relevance.\nPlenty has been written about the power of association and building a powerful brand. Blogs are naturally suited to present multiple kinds of content in a relevant context. With care, a blog can take advantage of a natural brain-based drive to make connections and learn. Blogs that introduce diverse yet contextual content then stack neatly into the process of online brand building.\nAs the open-source specialists at Contextual explain:\nBy associating content with an appropriate design, or look and feel, words can be given more meaning. For example an article on recession may have to do with the economy or a person's hairline. By providing graphics, headings, related content, and perhaps links to external research articles, the original article is given much more power and value than if the text alone were presented on a blank page (whether web-based or printed.)\nSpoon bending, as anyone who watched the first Matrix movie is familiar with, is the powerful telekinesis ability that trains the mind to shift physical reality.\nWow! Is there an app for that?\nI will assume you have no urgent need to train your mind to bend spoons, but, as a fellow content marketer, you do have the urgent need to present contextual content. Doing so expands the minds of your audience, and can shift the reality of your brand in the mind of others.\nContextual content gives you the Matrix-style edge over single-source, single-media, or single-silo content. Providing contextual content on a blog gives you a role as content curator and has the added benefit of working to establish a thought leadership position.\nLet me give you some boots-on-the-ground perspective.\nOur content marketing company, SixEstate, uses contextual content strategy a few ways. The client content we develop using our Newsblogging process synthesizes multiple sources into contextual relevance for our clients' audience. We primarily produce written material, but this is always supplemented with other contextual media, such as photos or video. The sources are clearly listed on every post so that site visitors can dig deeper into any topic discussed.\nWe use Zemanta to distribute posts from our client blogs into other, relevant sites. When our clients' posts appear on other blogs, it is win-win-win.\nFirst win: Our client expands their content's reach and simultaneously grows the expert contributor's platform.\nSecond win: The distributed niche news finds and educates an interested party already searching for more information, a service that elevates the leadership position of both sites.\nThird win: Site traffic, client inquiries, and brands grow.\nBending spoons with your mind might be outside the reaches of reality, but what good is a bent spoon, anyway?\nBending your content strategy to include contextual content, on the other hand, is easy and within reach. Whether by manual inclusion or with Zemanta's help, adding contextual content provides an experience that can extend your audience's minds, and your content's reach.\nKatie McCaskey is Content Director of SixEstate, a content marketing firm.

It's Like Bending Spoons With Your Mind!"}, {"body": "I wholeheartedly agree with David Meerman Scott about newsjacking: the process by which you inject your ideas or angles into breaking news, in real-time, in order to generate media coverage for yourself or your business. This can also apply to conferences in your industry to generate blog posts for yourself or your business/blog. Moreover, be one of the first with a great (almost) live report from an event or about a research in your field. You get to show your readers they're special by giving them exclusive news and advice from important events they couldn't attend and earn the chance to gain new readers due to great content from an event.\nJoe Pulizzi  -  Content Marketing World (Photo credit: toprankonlinemarketing)\nAlmost two weeks ago I attended Content Marketing World in Columbus, Ohio. As a former radio journalist I decided to write short reports from the event, mainly about what I'd hear about blogging and content marketing that would be helpful to Zemanta users.\nVery soon, however, I was going crazy. I was fuming; I couldn't blog live. So much was going on and I could write only when I got back to my hotel room to type on my PC.\nWhat did I learn at Content Marketing World about live blogging to generate coverage? Here are five tips for live blogging at a conference to reach new readers that otherwise wouldn't be reached.\n1. Invest in gadgets with great batteries\nAlthough we talk a lot about the relevance and quality of content, we must not ignore good technology. It is simply necessary to go to a conference with a great machine that allows you to blog live, not just tweet. So, I am definitely going to invest in a new great PC (like a mac) that has great batteries so I don't need to worry where I can plug it in every 20 \"bloody\" minutes.\n2. Blogging LIVE means LIVE\nMarketing and blogging events are full of ambitious bloggers who are friendly but still fighting for attention on the web. So, you need to be the first or among the first and GOOD. You must learn how to write relevant live reports while listening carefully to the presentation at the same time. Practice makes perfect.\n3. Write relevant posts\nDon't just blog for blogging sake, blog what's relevant to your niche, to your readers. There's no need to write thorough reports on everything that is said at the conference.\n4. Write how-to posts based on a presentation\nPosts should be focused on a particular presenter and their tips on how to do something better to get better results whatever they are in your niche. Distribute the post around the world wide web and make sure that the presenter knows about it. He/she will distribute it further, so you'll be able to reach the audience that you otherwise wouldn't.\n5. Write many shorter posts\nRather than writing one long and detailed conference report, you should rather write many shorter ones focusing on one topic. You should get multiple ideas/topics to write about for weeks to come after the conference.\nWhat are your experience in blogging from conferences and other events in your industry? What tips would you add to the list above?\nThe post 5 Awesome Tips for Live Blogging at a Conference appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "5 Awesome Tips for Live Blogging at a Conference"}, {"body": "Daniel Male is a search marketing manager for SmartSign.com, an e-commerce company selling B2B products in the printing industry. Their main product lines are signs, tags, labels and mats, but they also offer a number of free services such as their bike registry and safety quizzes. Daniel uses Zemanta's services to connect SmartSign.com's content with our network of bloggers and help with distribution and earning links from our bloggers.\nI first heard about Zemanta from Ross Hudgens during his presentation at a Distilled conference in April. I learned many things there, but Zemanta was hands-down my largest takeaway. Distilled's LinkLove conferences are supposed to inspire SEO ideas, which in my case, worked. Yet, besides just SEO, I walked away from the conference with something else entirely: a new method for content idea generation.\nI work for SmartSign, an e-commerce company that sells a wide range of B2B products and spans across dozens of different industries, notably safety, traffic, construction, and transportation. Our products' diversity creates opportunities for new content, but because our scope is so vast, it can be overwhelming to come up with ideas for fresh articles and blog posts that people will want to read (and ultimately link to). Our staff of writers uses a number of techniques to generate new content, but few initiatives have worked as well as looking through which Zemanta bloggers have linked to our articles.\nSearching for Answers\nI began by downloading my YTD recommendations report (June 7  -  August 31st). What started out as general assessment of how my campaign was performing turned into an eye-opening realization that a lot more was going on. After poring over nearly three months of data  -  30,607 recommendations on 233 different articles and blog posts  -  I began to notice some trends. A few of my articles had many times more recommendations than others. Other articles were acquiring lots of links, despite a scarcity of recommendations. Most striking though, is that many of the best-performing articles were all centered on similar topics. Since our content and research covers such a wide range of topics, I figured that the recommendations and generated links would be spread more or less evenly across our articles. I couldn't have been more wrong. Our performance was extremely top-heavy.\nI had hundreds of URLs to work with in my effort to find what our niche's most popular topics were, but not much else. To make things simpler, I assigned a single keyword to each article, \"replacing\" the URL. In the example below, I assigned my article on bike signage a keyword, or topic, called \"biking\".\nNote: Many of the articles had multiple themes to them. This particular post is about signage, bikes, and law. However, this article wasn't acquiring links because of its sign-related content. It was clear that my biking article was about bikes and was being recommended and linked to by bloggers writing about bikes. I used this same, albeit subjective, thought process to assign topics to all the URLs.\nAfter assigning each of the 232 articles a keyword/topic, I was left with 67 unique ones, 45 of which had yielded links. I was then able to sort my data by the number of links acquired, the number of recommendations, and the link conversion rate (\"LCR\"). Here's what I found.\nFindings\nCaveat: All of the information in this post including the examples is true, but for the sake of my company I am intentionally excluding much of our data. I don't want to give away all of our secrets!\nSmartSign's Top 10 most RECOMMENDED topics:\nTakeaway: These topics seem to be the most blogged about topics on the blogosphere that relate to SmartSign's niches. Who knew that out of all the topics that pertain to our company, biking, signs, and OSHA were the most popular? Only by consolidating our content into broader topics could I have learned this.\nIn fairness, Zemanta just makes recommendations to its users. The case could be made that there are many bloggers in relating niches that don't use it and would therefore not have the opportunity to link to our articles. Yet, we must remember that there are over 140,000 Zemanta users and they probably cover most topics out there. Also, bear in mind that these top 10 recommended topics are not necessarily the ones that have generated the most links. If I wanted to simply increase my recommendations, without also focusing on linkability, I could create content centered on these topics. However, as SEOs know (and are often shy to admit), impressions and time-on-site is good, but it's really the links that matter.\nSmartSign's Top 10 most LINKED-TO topics are:\nTakeaway: This is, of course, the metric that I really care about. These topics (mostly) represent the best combination of most blogged-about topics, accurate recommendations, and high-quality content. Like the previous list, this one helps me figure out which topics are most popular, but when comparing it to the other two charts, I can determine which of our articles are most linkable.\nAn interesting discovery is that \"drowning\", or swimming pool safety, has unexpectedly had thousands of recommendations, yet has only yielded 4 links. This leads me to believe that although there are a lot of bloggers out there who talk about swimming and water safety, our related content that covers the topic of drowning is probably low quality or irrelevant to what other bloggers care about. If I know this topic will get a lot of recommendations, I can now try to tap into the swimming pool safety \"blogging market\" with more appropriately targeted content. The recommendations are there; right now I just need to get my links up.\nSmartSign's Top 10 highest LINK CONVERSION RATES are:\nTakeaway: This chart shows topics that have yielded the most links with the fewest recommendations. This is a reflection of accurate recommendations and, mainly, high quality and original content. You will note that all of these have few recommendations, yet have still been acquiring links. The posts that fall under these topics are worth emulating in tone, writing style, photos, and keyword placement.\nNote: I have only included topics with multiple links to factor for \"flukes.\" There are a number of very specific articles that have had higher LCRs than many of the ones above, but they have only yielded one link. An article we produced on asbestos falls into this category. It is high-quality, but it's too specific of a topic, with not enough data (one link on 20 recommendations) to be significant for this study.\nHere are some other interesting gems I found from my data set:\nOut of 45 total link sources, (a/k/a topics,) just three of them, or 6.6% (\"osha\", \"biking\", and \"signs\") were responsible for 34.4% of the links.\nOur total campaign Link Conversation Rate is .4% (125/30,607), which seems, at a glance, to be poor  -  but in actuality is quite good.\nPeople really like talking about dog poop (899 recommendations).\nApplying the Changes After learning that there are hundreds (if not thousands) of bloggers out there that write about dog poop, OSHA, biking, traffic, distracted driving, and water safety, our team began focusing more content around these topics. It forced us to think of new content ideas that biking blogs would be interested in. We now track OSHA violations and the latest legal interpretations. We include pop-culture themes and interesting facts in our articles about signage and regulations.\nWhile writing, we include all the popular keywords under a given topic for each post. So, if I decide to write about bike lanes in New York City, with the umbrella topic of biking, I try to include as many of the bike related keywords as I can in the article (as well as in the URL and meta tags)  -  \"bikes\", \"bicycles\", \"cycling\" etc.  -  without keyword stuffing and sacrificing quality. That way, when a Zemanta blogger highlights one of the keywords in his post, our article has a greater likelihood of being recommended.\n(Zemanta Note: our recommendations are based on more than keyword matching. Zemanta can also judge relevancy of different topics mentioned inside the same text and put emphasis on the one deemed most important when recommending content. Our engine understands when somebody is speaking about London in context of Ontario, Canada or England and recommends appropriately. Recommendations are therefore more precise. The background knowledge comes from big databases and Zemanta's consistent learning.)\nFrom glancing at all of my data, I also learned that bloggers really like current events and newsy items. Most of our linked-to content has been from SmartSign blog posts about things like mining accidents, a new bike registry, or a human interest story.\nHere's a good example of how we unknowingly (before this case study) used this to our advantage. Aside from being potential fans, our main product lines have little to do with the Brooklyn Nets. But we were able to tie them into a post about how their logo was inspired by old subway signage, a highly relatable topic. Our content was now being recommended to Brooklyn and Brooklyn Nets blogs which ordinarily would have no reason to link to us. Focusing on a popular topic such as the Nets generated three quality links to our blog. It's worth it to make a point of merging something from our industry with a mainstream, popular topic for future pieces of content.\nHow YOU Can Get the Most Out of Zemanta\nThe changes SmartSign has implemented in its blogging strategy have led to a lower cost per earned link from a variety of authoritative bloggers, while the average Page Rank of linking root domains is just under 4. In case you would like to create a similar study of your articles campaign, here are the steps to do so.\nDownload your recommendations report, and open it up as an .xls file.\nGo through all of your URLs and assign each of them a single keyword or topic. This may take a while depending on how many articles you have indexed. You can do a shortened version of this by discounting any articles that have no significant link or recommendation figures. However, if you go this route, your data will be less accurate because you aren't using everything you've got.\nOnce you've assigned each article a topic, merge the data (recommendations, links, and LCRs) for all of the duplicate topics, so that each topic has only one line.\nThen, make 3 separate charts and sort them from highest to lowest for recommendations, links, and LCRs.\nBegin searching for trends and outliers. Once you have your data set up correctly, the rest comes easy. You will find things that you weren't even looking for and discover answers to questions that you never asked.\nI'm sure that other users have found their own creative ways to use Zemanta. If you have, or have any questions about my processes, I'd love to hear from you. Leave a comment, or drop me a note by way of twitter or e-mail.

Data has shown that websites and blogs that use rich snippets can increase their click-through-rates by up to 30%. And the best part about it? Only 9% of tech blogs are using rich snippets (or more specifically, Google's authorship attribute which is the most widely used). And adding rich snippets does more than just increase your CTR. Because users have a chance to review the additional information that you are providing them on the SERP (search engine results page), they are able to make a more educated decision before clicking through to your page.

You're not alone\nAccording to the soon-to-be published research, blogging is one of the most commonly used content marketing tactics. Indeed, it is considered among the 4 most effective tactics to boost your business. So, don't give up! It pays off to blog!\n2. You're not a masochist\nDon't torture yourself by thinking that each and every time you have to come up with something totally new, to create a new story. According to Ardath Albee, Marketing Interactions, if the existing stories continue to address your buyers' pain points, continue addressing those pain points with a refresh or an update on an already published article.\n3. You're who exactly?\nWho are you? Who is your company? What makes you both unique? What is your story, why do you do what you do? According to C.C. Chapman, author of the book Content Rules, you should figure this out to know how to tell your story through content.\n4. You should know why you're blogging\nYou should figure out WHY you're blogging, if you haven't yet. Only then you should think about how to do it. Developing a clear strategy and establishing goals early is critical in deciding the success of your content marketing endeavors.\n5. You live in a multi-platform world\n\"Content is an ecosystem and all platforms are interdependent,\" said Arjun Basu, Spafax. He argues, if you remove one platform or create content in silos, the entire ecosystem collapses. So think whether a blog is enough for your business. However, it's better to be the best across a few channels than to be mediocre across all channels, according to Ardath Albee, Marketing Interactions\n6. You should make your content shareable\nThis one is a neither new nor revolutionary lesson, but it has to be stressed constantly, because many bloggers simply forget about it. Make your content so good others want to share it (remember Jason Falls' advice on the best content marketing strategy). Moreover, make it easier for others to share it. Michael Stelzner, Social Media Examiner, added you should build a community on existing social networks. And if possible, build your own community onsite, so you can have full control of your fans.\n7. Your customers have the best stories, even about you\nYou have no idea what to blog about next? Marcus Sheridan, The Sales Lion, said it best: \"They ask, you answer\". Indeed, according to Deana Goldasich, Well Planned Web, your customers can tell your story better than you ever will and prospects will listen to other customers more than they'll listen to you. By the way, a single customer story can fuel a lot of content.\n8. You're not a pre-configured machine\nBut be careful. Content for content's sake doesn't get you anywhere, according to Brian Clark and Sonia Simone, Copyblogger.com.\n9. You always have time for blogging\nThe most misused excuse in our lives is: \"I don't have time for it.\" (#3 on our list of content production myths) We don't have time for exercising, we don't have time for blogging... Bullshit, says Marcus Sheridan. How come we always have time for having fun, eating, sleeping, even payroll? Marcus's advice is to look to blogging as you look at payroll. There's simply no debate; it's not an option.\n10. You're human\nJungle Jack Hanna gave the best advice in the end: \"Be passionate, be genuine, tell stories, know your content, and bring animals!\"\nWhat is the greatest lesson you've learned as a blogger?

This was a common question at this week's  second annual Content Marketing World in Columbus, Ohio. Zemanta was actively involved in the biggest content marketing event in the world as a sponsor of Content Strategy Track.\nJay Baer, Convince and Convert, had a powerful blogging message: \"Consumption alone doesn't matter. You want to look at whether prospects engage in other, more desirable behaviors as a result of your content, such as returning to your site in greater ratios than others,\" said Baer.\nWhat you, even or especially business bloggers, have to do is stop selling and start helping. Marcus Sheridan, The Sales Lion, agrees with this statement by Rachel Foster, Fresh Perspective. Blogging is about education and communication, according to Sheridan.\nHe dispelled 6 common content production myths:\n1. Getting started, then staying inspired.\nAccording to Sheridan, listening is the greatest content marketing tool in the world. Great listeners never run out of content. If you listen well, thousands of questions will come your way. Therefore, you should follow the golden rule of content marketing: \"They ask, you answer.\"\n2. My competitors will steal my secrets.\n\"You ain't got no secrets,\" yelled Sheridan. Anyone can go to Google and find out just about every answer to every question. Be a teacher so customers will look to you as the expert.\n3. \"I don't have time for content marketing.\"\nContent marketing is important to your business. Look to content marketing as you look at payroll.\n4. Thought leadership\n\"If you want to be a thought leader in your industry, then have a dang opinion, and share it.\"\n5. ROI\nEvery business needs to know how much its content is making for it in sales. \"Be the best teacher in the world on what you do. We have no idea how much info viewers will consume on our websites until we give it to them.\"\n6. Buy-in\nIn a company every employee has knowledge to share and has the ability to answer questions. Therefore, every employee needs to be a part of marketing.\nThe conference ended with a great presentation by legendary Jungle Jack Hanna.

There used to be one almost every day, now I'm lucky if a story spans more than two blogs once every three months.\nAll of this really means the death of discovery.\nBack to the future\nIt's 2015, the year of the hoverboard.\nTwitter  is an orgy of bots spamming bots.\nThe average Facebooker shares more baby pictures than party pictures.\nGoogle+ is a wasteland of geeks bragging about Circle configurations.\nThere are no more links\nThe  anchor tag  is still with us!\nBut it's only used to get people from one part of a website to another part. Well, most websites are one-page apps anyway ... due to something about cross-device compatibility.\nBut external linking is completely dead.\nGood Old Link's demise started when some bright person or another realized that there is no immediate value in linking to other websites. Even worse, not only did it take users away from their product, it advertised that other thing.\nAdvertising is a money game and nobody wants to do it for free. The Web of connected documents be damned!\nThe situation only worsened when  SEO  spammers started building link-back factories,  content farms  if you will, producing endless amounts of generic content to push their products higher up Google's search results. Soon, Google put penalties on content farming. Take that content farmers and SEO spammers! Ha!\nSmaller websites and even bloggers caught on, those that remained, stopped linking to cool things. Screw you cool young startup! Not only am I providing free advertising for you, you're harming my search results! However will the five hundred readers I have find me?\nFinding good websites became almost impossible. Search results were dominated by paid promotions, journalists butchering news without citing their sources ... all without linking to new sites, even Google struggled to build its index.\nMaster list of websites, by anselm23\nPeople turned to the whispernet of their time  -  social networks. Links were whispered. Carefully protected as the lore of a people long gone. Tiny parcels of information adapting to shifting conditions like a message in a game of telephones.\nWhen spammers caught wind of this they started shouting their own crap. For a small fee you could get content shared to a huge, huge tribe, thousands of people would see it and pass it onwards, the spammers would laud.\nJust like that, all useful content was screamed out of the collective mind. Only spam remained. But the spammers had another trick up their sleeves  -  bots started clicking on links. You have to drive those metrics, y'know!\nActionable, measurable metrics!\nNobody cares about the users. The users have all gone anyway. What matters is proving to your boss that X was shared a bazillion times and seen ten bazillion times.\nIt doesn't matter what was shared and what was seen! As long as all the graphs are going up, it means you're doing a good job.\nThe web wasn't a globally connected network anymore, it was just an endless wasteland of information pillars  -  ready to be explored one by one by anyone foolish enough to attempt the journey.\nBrave explorers took up the challenge.\nThey waddled the stream of tweets, they climbed the tall pillars of information and sometimes, just sometimes, they found something good. Something everybody should see.\nExplorer, by Artful Danni\nLink markets were created. Places where explorers could sell what they found in return for eternal fame as measured by something called \"karma\". It was the fairest of marketplaces, good content got a lot of karma and bad content didn't get any.\nIn theory, the bad explorers would eventually die out.\nInstead, the marketplaces became popular. Everyone knew magnificent explorers were sharing links here and only the good content reached The Holy Front Page!\nSo ... as is usually the case ... the marketplaces grew. But they lost their touch, and many of the best explorers simply left. Only the mediocre explorers, their fans and the spam remained. Alas, it was still better than waddling the torrentous stream of Twitter and much better than roughing it out on Google.\nEven this was no longer a walk in the park.\nNowadays, the only way to discover good content is somebody walking up to you saying Hey, there's something good here!\nLink Love\nThe more I thought about the question What would the world be like without links? the more I realized what I'm imagining isn't some dystopic future, it's happening right now!\nDiscovering things on Twitter has become nigh impossible, people are painfully selective about which Circle they share something to and  Facebook  is completely overrun with Page updates . You can hardly even see what your friends are up to anymore.\nLink markets have come and gone. Most failed. The cycle is usually one of initial excitement and an incredible signal-to-noise ratio. The community is growing as the direct result of Hey dude! You have got to see this website! It's where all the cool links are!\nHey dude, by Wonderlane\nFollowed ever so swiftly by Hey dude! You have got to see this website! It's where all the thought leaders mingle and click on stuff. They're the ones most likely to share it onwards and have a huge following of even more eyeballs! It's so rad!\nSoon, the gaming starts. People start pushing their own articles to the front page by ever so slightly nefarious means. It's not too bad. and the links don't last for more than an iota of a second if they're low quality. Eventually even good content has a hard time getting to where the users are  -  it keeps getting pushed down too quickly.\nRight now  HackerNews  and  Reddit  are top notch. But they too will die eventually.\nOne thing is for ever. Link Love. Those related articles at the bottom of posts. That friendly signpost from one piece of content to another. The friendly Hey, there's something cool over there! And it's related to what you've just read.

I'm sitting in my tiny office in a small city of Ljubljana in a small, mostly unknown country of Slovenia and yet I can easily communicate with people from all over the world and share my ideas and knowledge with them via an extraordinary machine called a PC. If that ain't extraordinary I don't know what is.\nSharing isn't just caring, it's networking. Networking has been key since the beginning of human race. Sharing knowledge, ideas, disagreements in such an easy, though still complicated way makes even my desire (that I know it'll never happen) to travel back in time obsolete.\nThe online world of blogs and other social media makes it so much easier for me  -  an introvert and person who likes to be left alone, albeit not lonely -  to connect with people I share the same desires and ideas with, who can enrich me intellectually, who help me get work ... The internet helps me expand my network all around the world; networking means \"meeting\" like-minded people, sharing ideas and exchanging knowledge in real time.\nOne can't live in isolation if they want to improve their ideas, thoughts, opinions, so they can contribute to a worldwide conversation that makes us all better.\nThe folks at Zemanta have been thinking about sharing.

Aram has blogged about a wide range of topics in his lifetime and is a guaranteed interesting read, Happy readings!\nWho are you?\nMy name is Aram Zucker-Scharff. I'm currently a new media consultant and freelance web developer. I'm also a journalist who has covered a variety of topics, mostly politics, video games and economics. I grew up in New York City and I'm living in the DC Metro area. I just finished a term working for George Mason University, also where I got bachelor's degrees in English and Information Technology. While I was there I got to work with the groups within the Office of Student Media, student-run news outlets, journals and media groups. I had a lot of fun helping students learn about all sorts of great online tools, like Zemanta, and how best to use them. Now I'm really enjoying building new tools and sites to use them on.\nWhat do you blog about?\nMy personal blog, HackText is all about narrative design, transmedia storytelling and the tools to do both. I'm fascinated by the different ways we can use technology to tell stories. The other place I do most of my writing is at Nightmare Mode, a site I helped develop that publishes critical conversations about video games.\nWhen did you start using Zemanta?\nSometime around late 2008. I was doing political blogging for a site I had helped start up and then later for United Press International around that time. I was always looking for related content to help build context for my articles and related images that I could freely use. Zemanta happened to do both of those things. I picked it up because I was using Windows Live Writer at the time and I had stumbled across it in a list of plugins for that program. I no longer use Windows Live Writer, but I never stopped using Zemanta.\nHow does Zemanta help you blog better?\nWhen I spoke to classes about the best way to blog, one of the things I would always emphasize was the importance of including an image with every post. I'd always tell students that the best thing to do was, if you didn't have your own graphics, to find one that could be used under creative commons and I always point to Zemanta as the best tool out there to find related images on deadline. That's one of the main ways I use it. It's also great for rapidly adding links into the body of an article to reference important relevant sites, like reviews, home pages and Wikipedia entries.\nPower User Tip:\nWhen doing journalistic work I often find additional sources, ways to enhance an article or leads for a new article by looking in the related content links. That area of Zemanta has always been hugely helpful to me. In addition, I just found out that I can use the WordPress Zemanta plugin to assign featured images for posts, which is going to be a huge time-saver in the future.", "title": "Zemanta Power User of The Week: Aram Zucker-Scharff of George Mason University and HackText"}, {"body": "Every individual blogger competes with millions and millions of other bloggers for attention, or at least one other blogger in their niche. What are YOU doing to make sure that readers come back to YOUR blog? Do you know how to please them so that you don't lose them?\nMore and more Internet users need more and more great content to feel satisfied. (Photo credit: John Swords)\nLet's face it. We're a junkie society. I am not talking about the extreme kind that needs medical attention; we like a lot of things so much, we seem to be dependent on them - be it junk food, sports, porn or Twitter.\nIt's natural to seek out pleasurable experiences. The more we get of something, the more it makes us \"feel good\", the more we want it. I believe that only blogs that can satisfy their junkies can prosper in the long run.\nLet's look at this from the perspective of online porn industry. So much has been written and said in the past few years about porn (web) addicts. What the best, most popular porn sites offer is a seemingly endless variety and quantity of \"relevant\" content. Their customers keep coming back for more stimuli and each time they expect to find something new and more stimulating than the last time. The most successful porn sites are the ones with a massive amount of content.\nWhether this goes to the extreme, i.e. an addiction that needs to be addressed, is another story. I'm not a psychologist. However, porn or not, we, especially in the Western societies, are all presented by an increasing variety and availability of pleasurable options. And we tend to be drawn to those that can satisfy us \"all night long\".\nBlogs are not exempt. Think of your niche junkies; he/she is someone who spends a lot of their time on the Internet seeking and consuming information and knowledge. They prefer websites that offer a seemingly endless variety and quantity of regularly updated relevant content.\nSo, how can you please your pleasure-seeking readers and not lose them forever?\nYou have to provide a consistent stream of content if you want to build a following for your blog. That means regular posts of consistent quality.\nUpdate your blog as regularly (and necessary) as possible.\nYour landing page should give an impression that your blog has an endless amount of relevant and great content.\nDon't attempt to satisfy ALL. Niche is good; it doesn't mean you exclude people, it rather means that you help the right people to find your blog.\nLink like crazy. People love links.

I started writing for me, to recount the experiences of mine that I knew others would appreciate, laugh about, or learn from, to process, and to vent. I'd always been a writer at heart, narrating my way through my daily life, but circumstances, adulthood, and having bills to pay lured me away.\nby Momma Be Thy Name\nThe post Happy 1st Anniversary to Stephanie at Momma Be Thy Name! appeared first on Zemanta Blog.", "title": "Happy 1st Anniversary to Stephanie at Momma Be Thy Name!"}, {"body": "We're proud to present Erik Renko, a head of consumer analytics department in Mercator, the biggest retail company in Slovenia and in South East Europe, as Zemanta Power User of the week. He runs a unique blog that focuses on product placement in pop culture Brands & Films. A great source of news and information on the subject.\nYou run a very interesting blog. Where did you get the idea for it?\nBack in the days I graduated with a thesis on product placement. At that time product placement wasn't as widespread as it is today, but I loved watching movies and was interested in marketing, so product placement was a perfect combination for me. After I graduated I ended up in marketing research, but I never stopped spotting brands in movies and reading articles about product placement.\nWhy did you launch a blog about this topic?\nI attended a monthly meeting of Slovenian Marketing Association and there was a presentation on product placement and branded entertainment. Suddenly it occurred to me that I might still know something about that topic and a blog about product placement could be a good idea. I've checked if there were some existing blogs, but haven't found anything special. After a few days of thinking I asked a few friends what they think about me writing a blog and I received a very encouraging response. And then I just started to write.\nWhat motivates you to keep blogging?\nMainly two things: I still haven't told everything that I'd like to say and I believe I have interesting ideas to share. The second thing is a somewhat private goal that I'd wish to achieve and is only known to a few people.\nAre you a \"neutral\" observer of the phenomenon?\nWell, I'm not part of the entertainment industry, so I don't have inside information on stories I post. I tend to be an observer of the phenomenon, but not strictly neutral. My main goal is to analyze certain aspects of product placement and give an opinion: positive or negative. Sometimes I write about bad examples, but it's much more interesting to examine truly great cases.\nThis is very interesting, so, I have to ask, what are your observations about product placements in the past and today?\nIn the past product placement wasn't used in every big Hollywood movie. It was more an exception to the rule. But nowadays product placement is an integral part of marketing communications and one of the ways of financing the movie. In my opinion product placement is now a strictly business oriented field, which makes it even more difficult to execute some really memorable cases. Sometimes it's so blatant and poorly done that I really hate it, but in some rare cases you just have to admire the creativity of all parties involved in achieving a memorable stuff.\nWhat about product placement in blogs? Does stuff like this even exist? What's your take on it?\nI think it exists and I even got an offer to publish a guest post, which would be totally free of charge for me, but some words would have had backlinks or some products would be mentioned in otherwise organic context. At that time I refused the offer, but I'm not against it. I believe that there's nothing wrong if you mention brands or include photos of them in your blog posts. As an author you have to maintain your integrity and professionalism  -  you just have to be careful, because you don't want to damage your own brand.\nWhen did you start using Zemanta?\nI started using Zemanta a few months after I published my first blog post and I've been using it for more than two years.\nHow does Zemanta help you blog better/easier?\nI'm certainly much quicker and sometimes I get some ideas from your suggestions that just weren't part of my original story.\nPlease share a Zemanta tip!\nUse it from day one.

In all honesty, I am not sure what the difference is. However, online magazines or blogs or even vlogs, whatever you call them, really can change our lives for the better.

I was immediately impressed by the way it looked, the reason good enough to make me stay on the page and browse deeper. The Images are really impressive and colorful and they are not even pics.

It's curated and provided by a set of people from around the world passionate about videos, showcasing clips from the global street culture.\nTheir goal is to share and spread awareness about global, undiscovered, alternative and subcultural, even underground, video productions. \"A spot where you can dig into the latest from for example the urban dance scene in South Africa, and check out videos from every corner of the world, and last but not least, where you can keep an eye on the future of the street,\" says the magazine's editor Heather Ferrigan. The vlog, blog, or magazine (whatever you prefer) basically provides visual storytelling  -  it is a phenomenal place full of great content.\nI was really impressed and curious so I contacted the editorial staff. Their take is that videos \"mirror culture and society\". Heather told me: \"Video productions are also important from an anthropological point of view, as an artifact, that says a lot about time, aesthetics, medium, and used technology. From a cultural point of view, videos provide an insight to taste and trends.\" What's even more impressive in today's Americanized media landscape is that they raise awareness about other non-western, undiscovered movements or cultures. Heather explains: \"Our ambition is to perhaps provide opportunities for global video productions and talented filmmakers to be showcased to a much broader international audience.\"\nSo, what can other bloggers, personal or branded, learn from Stocktown.com?\nHave a clear overall message.\nKnow your objectives.\nUtilize the best images and videos you can.\nHave a strong editorial policy.\nWhat's your take on blogs generating public awareness about issues round the world?

(Photo credit: Thomas Hawk)\nQuora is an online forum that aggregates questions and answers to specific topics. Users can collaborate by editing questions and suggesting edits to other users' answers. The forum is organized by people and their interests so everybody can find, collect, and share the information most valuable to each and every individual.\nI see Quora as a type of blogging. A blogger's potential reader has a question and the blogger answers that question. This is exactly what blogging is supposed to be, especially blogging for a brand. Marcus Sheridan of The Sales Lion is one who says frankly that blogging should be answering the questions your readers/buyers ask you. This is exactly what Quora is all about.\nWhen someone wants to know more about something, Quora delivers them answers and content from people who share their interests and people who have first-hand knowledge. Aren't we, the bloggers, just that? We try to share ideas, influence public opinion, get feedback on our thoughts, and earn reputation. And to do this we must create great content and get distribution of it to a target audience.\nWhy bloggers should use Quora:\n1. It's where you'll find potential readers\nMy experience is that Quora users are people who have something relevant to say and seek relevant answers to their questions. Each question page aims to become the best resource for anyone with that same question. Therefore, Quora is a perfect place to \"recruit\" new readers for your blog who may eventually become your customers. On Quora, answered questions get exposed in the feed to people following that topic which leads to distribution and exposure to new people.\n2. It's where you can increase your credibility\nBy being active on Quora and leaving useful answers on the forum, you increase your own credibility. Quora reminds me of conversation as much as blogs do. By being active on this online forum you contribute to the conversation and spread the knowledge, share what you know with those who'd like to know.\n3. It's where you establish yourself as expert voice\nThe aforementioned may make you an expert voice on a topic in the long run. You may even become a domain expert, which will additionally increase the flow of traffic to your blog and consequently boost your business. Just imagine! If you're the one who gives the best and most relevant answers to questions about the topic you're an expert in, you may become the trusted source of information and knowledge on that topic.\n4. It's where you find what topics are worth pursuing\nQuora is full of questions and answers. It's a perfect way to look for your next blog post ideas; especially if you're an active participant of a debate that arose out of a question. When the debate is mature enough, it's time to write a post about the topic, maybe even a series of related posts on the same topic. Besides, you've spent enough time on this topic to be able to write a thoughtful and relevant blog post on it. Moreover, Quora tells you what topics are worth tackling, by letting you know what people think are good questions.\nDo you see online forums like Quora as a type of blogging?

The modern \"hippies\" today don't yet have a definition that's widely agreed upon or accepted  -  and that's what I'm working on, rebranding today's idea of \"hippie.\nFrom corporate influence to energy solutions to pure food  -  the duties of today's hippie are no longer about protecting the earth, but ensuring humanity is capable of surviving the coming years. Today's hippies are a little more aware of things like what happens after you flip a light switch and the impact of where you decide to shop. I definitely, and proudly, put myself in with this definition. Go ahead and call me a hippie, it's what I've been aiming for all along.\nAs you say, \"the duties of today's hippie are ... ensuring humanity is capable of surviving the coming years\". And you blog about living sustainably. Can one also be a sustainable blogger? Can the two be compared?\nYes, sure, anything can be sustainable. You'd first have to think about what definition of sustainability is most useful. On it's own, \"sustainable\" is a system that consumes and wastes at a rate the environment surrounding it can handle it.\nI came across an article recently asking whether or not cloud computing was actually \"green.\" It was a discussion of the energy data centers were using to store and share the information that they were designed for. Allegedly, data centers are now leaving a bigger carbon footprint than all of the airlines combined. Blogging has given everyone the chance to have whatever voice they want. But there is a price to giving everyone a platform, and that price is in the construction of the platform. It's easy to forget that our devices plug into wall sockets that give us, largely, coal-fired energy.\nEnergy is being consumed in the production, hosting, and consumption of content. Every day a year's worth of video is uploaded to YouTube. Thousands of domains are being registered, thousands of websites go live in some capacity or another. We want to create content, but how do we do it on a sustainable scale  -  both in the responsible consumption of energy and in making sure we just aren't rehashing the exact same ideas and content over and over?\nAs for energy  -  that's up to everyone. Getting data centers to switch to wind and solar power. To being a little less mindless in your net browsing. Maybe even in demanding higher quality of content from publishers by not wasting time on sites with stolen content. As for ideas  -  I doubt we'll ever run out of them so long as every blogger out there has the guts to say the very thing that led them to start a blog.\nDo you consider yourself a blogger?\nI absolutely consider myself a blogger. Writing and publishing content is a start, but a worthwhile blogger takes the time to connect their publishing with an audience in an effective way. Most see it as \"a way to get traffic.\" The best way to do this is to engage communities  -  even if they aren't directly yours.\nWhat made you launch a blog?\nAt the time I was doing a lot of new things. Just bought a house, broke ground on my first gardens. When you have a house, energy consumption takes a whole different precedence. Sure, you want to make sure your home is warm/cool at the right times so you can be comfortable (that's why you got a home in the first place, right?) but how do you do so without racking up a huge energy bill?\nIs the internet now over saturated with blogs?\nThere is a stat somewhere that a new website starts every two seconds. Thousands of new domains are registered every day. Not every domain becomes a site. Not every site is a blog. Most blogs see only one or two posts before they are forgotten into the abyss of the net.\nSaturated? Absolutely not. Is our day to day life saturated with conversation? Albeit, there are a ton of garbage blogs, a lot of blogs that are little more than aggregators and content stealers. There are definitely a lot of blogs and trying to read through them all will burn you out pretty quickly. I'll say what's been said before  -  every blog needs to have that ONE unique thing they are trying to say. With Not Quite Hippie  -  it is that the sustainability mindset starts at home and grows outward. I ensure that all of my content speaks to that in some capacity.\nEffective blogging isn't so much about the content as it is the conversations which surround it. From the tweets to the comment sections  -  what other people have to say is as important as what you've written. For every post I write, I probably write at least 20 emails to people  -  looking for guest posts, promotion opportunities, and just answering questions from interested parties.\nWhen did you start using Zemanta?\nHonestly, I don't remember when  -  I'd peg it around 6 months back. As a blogger who reads a ton of blogs, eventually I have no choice but to notice the tools that others are using. Zemanta was one of these tools.\nHow does Zemanta help you blog better/easier?\nI run my primary blog on WordPress, and Zemanta helps me connect with relevant content that works to make the content I'm working on more complete. I also run a creational sustainable blog on Tumblr. It works well for SEO purposes and to help me tap into the huge community in Tumblr made up of other curationists. On Tumblr, Zemanta's tag suggestion tool is fantastic for getting your content aligned with the right audience. It's amazing how many users of tumblr are in the dark about their system of tags and how to use them advantageously.\nWhat's your Zemanta Power Tip?\nOffer up your content. The more places your stuff has a chance to show up, the better chance you have of gaining a brand new audience. IF the brightest future of blogging is because of the community, then be a part of the community.", "title": "Zemanta Power User - David Pennington of Not Quite Hippie"}, {"body": "I came across a blog post by Gini Dietrich, one of the co-authors of Marketing in the Round: How to Develop an Integrated Marketing Campaign in the Digital Era, titled Is Blogging Dead or Are Companies Not Trying Hard Enough? Blogging is definitely not dead; it's more so the second half of her question.\nEnough already!\nAllow me to rant first  -  a reaction to the first half of Gini's aforementioned post title. I've already seen so many posts and news pieces on how blogging is actually pass\u00e9, that it's dying. For crying out loud! Seriously? This seems to be a repeatable cycle with every new medium or marketing tool.\nWhen TV became popular they were calling the end of movie theaters.\nThen the end of TV, commercial radio station, music, newspapers...\nAnd now they're saying Facebook is about to die; no, Twitter is...\nIt is the end of print... radio was supposedly dying.\nOh wait, none of them actually passed away! They all survived! How? By simply adapting to new realities. That's all.\nI don't know why we are so obsessed with announcing the end of a medium or marketing tool. I really would like to know why, anyone?\nThank you for letting me vent a bit. Now let's get back to Gini's post of what's happening to branded blogs.\nGini was reacting to April's USA Today report about more companies abandoning their blogs in favor of social media. They mention a study by the Dartmouth branch of the University of Massachusetts, that says the percentage of companies that maintain blogs fell from 50% in 2010 to 37% in 2011 . \"So, I see. Based on Wall Street and fast-growth companies, blogging is down, and now it's time to claim the whole blogosphere is dead,\" she writes sarcastically.\nShe thinks this is happening because companies realize blogging isn't easy: \"It's hard to generate good content even once a week. It's hard to cultivate a community. It's hard to grow traffic. It's a thankless job most days.\"\nI browsed through the Z-Blog and discovered that its recurrent theme is that business blogging brings results\nif you know what your goal is\nwhy your brand opened the blog in the first place\nif you know your target audience well\nif you measure the success of your blog and adapt as you go\nWhat I'd like to add to this is you shouldn't just decide you're going to have a blog. My posts The Art of Thinking Like a Real Blog Editor and Simple but Crucial Tips for Editing Blog Posts are clear: a company blog needs a great editor, mostly for reasons listed above.\nI have heard so many many times: \"This doesn't work.\" \"This\" could be a blog, a customer magazine, a Facebook page... And then we go through the channel and see how it was done and discover obvious reasons for failure.\nUsually, it goes something like this: a C-level gets blinded by the new channel or medium, by the shining buzzword. So they decide they should do it too. And they open a blog, or Facebook page, or start working on a new magazine or open a Pinterest profile etc. They're so enthusiastic in the beginning. But slowly, after only a few weeks or so, they lose interest in the channel. It may still be updated from time to time, but it's mostly just there, a reminder of enthusiasm they once had and of promise it once showed.\nLadies and gentlemen, I am definitely not the first one to tell you: it's just doesn't work that way.\nThere have been quite a few reports and studies that show how blogging affects leads. Gini mentions Hubspot's findings: for companies that do blog, their monthly leads increases by 67% (for B2B) and 88% (for B2C). The survey also shows that updating your blog just once a week increases your leads by 77%.\nMost of those who consider their company blog a failure and believe they were misled by thinking that blogging is an effective marketing tool are usually looking at wrong measurements and are impatient  -  they expect quick ROI.\nBut how can they even assess the effectiveness of their branded blog\nif the blog has no strategy\nif they don't really know why they need/want a blog\nif the blog has no plans what and how to measure and how to adapt to results\nif their blog isn't an integral part of their overall business and marketing strategies with clear objectives\nif they don't know what their main story is\nif they don't have a long-term plan (at least the one that spans more than just a month or two in the future)\nif they don't make a plan who and what is going to post and how often\nif they don't strategically name the best possible editor they can for the JOB\nBasically it's because they never really ask WHY and answer each and every WHY in details.\nIt may seem like I am repeating something that has been beaten to death over and over and over again. But it's amazing how companies keep making the same mistakes that lead them to believe that blogging is like whatever.\nIt isn't, you just have to do it right! Or as Bostjan says vividly: \"Blogosphere is pervasive and indispensable.\"\nTrue, it isn't easy. It can be tedious. It is time-consuming. It may not bring results, at first. But do it right and you will enjoy it. And reap desired rewards.\nJust please, approach it as you'd approach any other business investment.

Jamie shares her insight on modest fashion, beauty & lifestyle, and advice to encourage, empower, and inspire girls. She says, \"Having the Zemanta window within my blogging platform means I can stay on that page without toggling back and forth to find what I need for my blog post. Gotta love order and simplicity!\" Happy readings!\nWho is Model Me Girl?\nMy name is Jamie. I'm just a girl who loves God more than anything; and incidentally possess a fondness for modest fashion, beauty, and lifestyle. I believe true beauty radiates from the inside out. I try to cover all the bases - from faith to fashion, and beyond. In my non-blogging life, I'm an awesome auntie (or so I've been told) who is relentlessly bullied by my high maintenance Shih Tzu. Depending on the day, I'm a singer/songwriter, worship leader, teacher, poet, and an undercover health professional. Not to sound like a personal ad, but I love: my family; animals; nature; hiking; things that sparkle; the letter \"J\"; art/design/photography; reading/writing; books; Bible study; stalking mommy blogs; imagining I can sew and draw; Glue Dots; Mod Podge; and DIY projects and crafts.\nDo you consider yourself a blogger?\nYes, sometimes I consider myself a blogger. Other times I just consider myself a girl who writes.\nWhat makes someone a blogger?\nA blogger infuses their personality into their posts, whether it's a corporate blog, individual, or group.  I believe a true blogger participates in and interacts with a community. A blogger is someone who is engaging while being informative - and welcome or not, gives opinions. The awesome blogger offers more information and insight on a topic, issue, service, interest, or brand than what you'd get via the typical news coverage or static web page.\nWhat do you blog about?\nWhat don't I blog about? I am Jamie of all trades, and master (or is that mistress?) of quite a few of them. I blog about modest fashion, beauty, and lifestyle. I blog from a Christian perspective when I talk about personal and spiritual development for girls, which includes: body and self-image, self-esteem issues, relationships, faith in Jesus Christ, and being a godly girl. I also blog about health, DIY/crafts, food/recipes, and whatever comes to mind. Watch out Martha and Oprah!\nWhat made you launch a blog?\nI ultimately launched Model Me Girl because I want to show girls that modest fashion isn't boring, and does not equal wearing wallpaper; and that if we find our identity in God, we can embrace being beautiful and beloved - flaws and all. I grew up watching my mom design clothes and wedding dresses, and spending long hours in front of her sewing machine. She even made cute clothes for my fashion dolls. Although I'm a horrible illustrator, I used to sketch tons of outfits as a girl. What can I say? I like fashion. Even so, I want girls to see that true beauty and being fashionable is an inside job, manifested on the outside; and there is nothing wrong with humbly accepting and radiating the beauty we possess. Lots of girls are missing healthy doses of self-esteem. I want to be a positive and empowering light for girls and women through Model Me Girl. Oh, yeah, and being a good girl is not outdated.\nWhat is the role of blogs in fashion? Who are they aimed at?\nFashion blogs are all about perception. What do you see as fashionable? What's your personal style? Fashion blogs are reflection of culture. The role of blogs in fashion is to give more insight about styles, brands, designers, the industry, and most importantly, the people who wear the clothes and accessories. Us. I believe fashion blogs are targeted to whoever makes up a particular blogger's audience. I do believe members of the professional fashion industry keep an eye on the fashionistas, street wear and fashion enthusiasts, etc.  Some of them may even get ideas from us! It becomes a matter of who influences whom. It's full circle. Each blogger finds their niche and goes from there. Fashion bloggers definitely have the power to influence the fashion industry.\nWhat makes a good fashion blog?\nThe fashion finds and sets I create reflect what I wear and like. A good fashion blog is one that is authentic and birthed out of passion and purpose. It represents the true style and opinions of the blogger, and is not a copycat blog. A good fashion blog has consistency. People get behind people who are committed to their cause.  A good fashion blog is inspirational and doesn't have unrelated content just to fill empty spaces.\nWhen did you start using Zemanta?\nA little under a month ago when I looked at my Fashion Traffic account and said, \"What's this?\" I checked out the Zemanta site and signed right up.\nHow does Zemanta help you blog better/easier?\nOh my! Zemanta is great. I don't have to think about tags, keywords, or inline text links. Zemanta does the work for me. Having the Zemanta window within my blogging platform means I can stay on that page without toggling back and forth to find what I need for my blog post. Gotta love order and simplicity! Also, Zemanta lets me be in control of related content. I can choose to reference my own previously published post or someone else's.\nHave you integrated Fashion Traffic into your Zemanta assistant?\nWhy, yes I have! I discovered Zemanta through Fashion Traffic. The Zemanta assistant literally pulls the browse products capability into my blogging platform. Just put in a keyword and Zemanta pulls resources from Fashion Traffic. This is a time and resource saver. No need for multiple windows and tabs to be open.\nPower User Tip (please share a Zemanta tip!)\nLooking for more images and not sure what to search for or use to complement your post? Take a hint from Zemanta's suggested inline text links. Works for me. In one of my posts, I didn't think to add a certain image until I saw the inline text link.", "title": "Zemanta Power User - Model Me Girl"}, {"body": "In the past few weeks, we've come to only one logical and sensible conclusion: your corporate blog needs a great editor. As I wrote a few weeks ago: \"You were given this great responsibility without being mentored on how to become a corporate blog editor. Most likely, senior management within the company doesn't even know that editing a blog is usually a full-time job that requires an extremely dedicated person.\"\nEditing a blog post is so much more than just a spellcheck. (Photo credit: engineroomblog)\nNot just a dedicated one, but also someone who knows what it means to edit material for final publication. A corporate blog shouldn't be just a series of occasional random posts. A blog editor doesn't mean someone who gets a post, checks spelling, and posts it online as it was received. That's not called editing.\nI.E. an effective corporate blog, like any other content marketing tool, consists of well-planned and thoroughly edited posts that build a brand community in the long run.\nLast week I discussed what a great blog editor needs to consider when working on a corporate blog. This post is about what a great corporate blog editor must consider after he gets a post under consideration for publication.\nFirst raw review\nLet's assume that you've already considered everything on this list. You have an editorial plan, you know who's writing what post, and you've already discussed it with the author(s). Today is the day he/she sends you the first draft. If it's not an author you know that you're going to get a great final version from, then your deadline for post submission should be ahead enough so there's enough time to do revisions.\nWhen you get a post, no matter what the format (text, video, audio, pics, or a mix of two or all), you check if it's submitted according to your blog guidelines. If not, ask the author to make necessary corrections.\nIt's very useful to write a detailed, albeit not too restrictive set of guidelines. They are the foundation for building your corporate blog as a recognizable brand channel, rather than being a mess that has hardly anything to do with your brand. Check out magazines, newspapers, even broadcasting news; think about the elements that help you identify them immediately and how easy it is for you to follow them.\nIn addition, the blog guidelines help you, the editor; they make your life so much easier. Right?\nDoes it make sense?\nIf the post is in accordance with the guidelines, check whether it's logical. Does it make sense? Is it constructed logically? Is there a readable flow of thoughts? Or does it (or parts of it) confuse you?\nIf there's anything that confuses you or you don't understand, or if you think there are parts that need extra clarification, ask the author to make necessary changes. Be clear with your comments.\nIs it relevant?\nIs the post relevant to your target audience? Does it address any of your readers' pain points? Does it suggest a solution(s) to the problem?\nBasically, you must assess whether your readers can learn something substantial and apply that to their lives by reading the post. How does it make their lives better/easier? How does it make them \"smarter\"?\nIs the intro attractive enough?\nIs the intro flashy enough? Does it grab attention of (potential) readers?\nA good intro is short enough, it addresses the target audience and their pain points directly. If possible, it should contain a piece of information that they may find surprising/shocking. A great intro lets the readers know what follows and why they should keep reading.\nIs the headline worthy of retweet?\nThe same applies to the heading. According to Bostjan, you should ask yourself whether the headline \"tells the story of the post, is attractive enough, is relevant to your target audience\".\nDoes it have a call for action?\nIn the end, is the post interactive? Does it challenge the readers enough so they'd respond with a comment? Does it ask them to leave a comment, to continue the conversation?\nAre you a corporate blog editor? What other advice would you add? What challenges do you face as editor?", "title": "Simple but Crucial Tips for Editing Blog Posts"}, {"body": "You write a post. You publish the post online. You promote the post on your social networks. And you keep coming back to check how many people have already read it, shared it online. Sometimes, even only minutes after you updated your blog.

Only two Facebook likes in the first half hour?\"\nWait and they will come. (Photo credit: robertgourley-photo)\nWhoever does this, please stand up. I'm sure many of you have recognized yourselves. It's a natural response. We all want to be loved/read. Indeed, the audience/your readers make you a blogger. \"A blogger, if he/she's not already a known columnist or journalist, has to work hard to attract readers to the blog and to keep them coming back,\" I wrote.\nWhat about the following scenario? You write a post. You publish the post online. You promote it on your social networks. After a day or two you stop coming back to check how many people have read or shared it. You move on to another post, though wondering why this one isn't as popular as you thought it would be. A week, maybe weeks and months pass by. Suddenly you notice something's happening with that already forgotten post. In the meantime, after you moved on, it has gained traction. The numbers have suddenly begun to rise. What you dreamt the first hour and the first day after you updated the blog with this post it happened much much later, when you already gave up and moved on.\nThere are so many reasons why the above scenario happens from time to time. It depends on each individual case; sometimes it is just a small thing (usually a perplexing one) that triggers a ripple effect. But it does say something about a long lasting power of great online content.\nMost if not all advice online about what to do after you've written a new blog post aim at teaching you how to get immediate results, that is on the day you publish the post. But don't discount the possibility of getting large spikes in traffic and conversions weeks or even months after you actively promoted a new post.\nDon't think that when you updated your blog with a new post it was the only perfect timing for it. That perfect time may come later. Something may happen that brings people to that \"already forgotten\" post. Isn't that one of the reasons why blogs are open archives of your content? It doesn't make sense to think a blog post deserves attention only days after it's been published online. Then why don't we just delete them after a few days, right?\nSome would say, Bostjan, but there is a correlation between when I update a blog and an increase in traffic to it. Yes, for the most part. But you should always have in back of your mind an expectation that maybe the perfect time for an individual blog post is yet to come. You can reap the awards of writing weeks and months later. I don't know about you, but this makes the whole blogging thing even more exciting, because it just isn't the case of \"what's hot today is old news tomorrow\".

This isn't your regular Z-Blog interview, instead we asked Bill a few questions and let him respond the best way he can  -  by writing a story his own way.  Buckle up, this is a reading adventure.\nTHE ZEMANTA PROGRAM GIVES ME 'A SECOND SET OF HANDS'\nLet me introduce myself, I am the former owner, publisher and editor of the Gloucester City News Inc., (GCN) a weekly newspaper with 20,000 readers.  The Gloucester City News, located in Gloucester City NJ, was incorporated in 1929. Our family owned the paper from 1948 to 2005. We also owned the Camden County Record, a weekly with circulation in the City of Camden NJ.\nFrom the time I was a little guy I wanted to be a reporter. I started my newspaper career in 1966 at the age of 21.  In 1978 my father retired an I was named editor of both newspapers. My wife Connie and I brought the Gloucester City News in 1985.  Although we no longer own it, I still write a weekly column for the Gloucester City News.\nLooking for another avenue to express my views we launched ClearysNoteBook (CNBNews.net) on July 31, 2006. It was touch and go in the very beginning as I knew nothing about building a website. Once I got the hang of it I had a ball. After all those years of running a weekly newspaper I could now write a breaking news story that would be viewed immediately across the wide world web. I was amazed that I could easily build a photo album loaded with pictures of a football game. The idea that I could shoot a video of a sporting event, or a parade and have it loaded on my site was also a thrill.\nA few years ago CNBNews helped in the capture of a bank robber. Local police reached out to our news site with a photo of the suspect. Within hours the man was caught thanks in part to that alert posted on CNBNews.\nCNBNews is a one man show. On a daily basis I view 200 emails looking for topics that are news worthy. I write commentary, edit copy submitted for posting, shoot photos and videos, design ads, talk with customers and so forth. In between I am posting 12 to 20 articles a day, seven days a week.\nHelping me from the very beginning was Zemanta. In seconds their program is linking similar topics and images to my current article. In doing so my readers stay longer on our blog.

Others might want to use it as well. The best way to do that is offering it up as a service  -  a RESTful API even.\nHey, it made Twitter famous. Surely it will help you gain some traction as well ... Might even make you some money! Now we're talking!\nSo ... what goes into making an API?\nYou just take the same interface your over-architected architecture uses internally, open it up, announce it on HackerNews and Twitter and Reddit and away we go. Right? Right.\nNot right.\nTo offer a public API you need:\nsome way to authorize developers\nthrottling control so you don't get swarmed\ndeciding whether you're going to charge money or not\nusually when charging, more requests means more money -> you need a way of enforcing quotas\ngood tools to see what's happening with the service\ngood documentation\nsupport\nsupport\nsupport\nDid I mention you are going to have to offer support?\nEffort\nOh and don't forget permissions, maybe you want to give different people access to different endpoints of the API. Maybe some parts of the API have different usage quotas than others, or perhaps the throttling behaves differently depending on how many resources it takes to service different requests.\nSuddenly, this is much more than you bargained for  -  all you wanted is to simply throw an API out there, see if it sticks and maybe collect some side income for your startup.\nI know, I've been there.\nA few years ago I offered an API without making sure I'm doing it properly  -  it's just a single REST call, what could possibly go wrong? As it turns out, plenty.\nA bunch of people started using the API and I had no way of measuring or knowing that. All I could see was that the servers suddenly started melting and that no matter what I did they wouldn't bloody stop. Turned off everything and the servers were still melting.\nThen I remembered that throw-away API offering that got a bit of traction on HackerNews and a tiny bit on Reddit and quite a bit on Twitter. Shut down access to that, stopped the servers from melting and suddenly started receiving emails from disgruntled developers \"Hey, I was relying on that API! WTF happened!? How dare you take it off?\"\nScrew you, you didn't even have the courtesy of telling me that you're using it.\nNo fault of their own of course, I was the one who's supposed to have developer accounts, throttling, usage quotas and whatnot. The developers just saw a cool API and started using it.\nHow to properly offer an API\nAuth, by oztenphoto\nAs mentioned before, you are going to need a lot of ... stuff, if you're going to make this a pleasurable experience both for you and your users.\nEspecially your users.\nOne way is to build all of the infrastructure yourself  -  but that takes a lot of time and isn't very sexy at all. Much better to worry about the core problems of your product than making sure some side thing works robustly.\nLucky for you (and your users) there exist a bunch of services whose purpose is making APIs fairly easy and palatable.\nThe ones I know of are 3scale, Mashape and Mashery.\nEssentially all of these services provide stuff like developer keys, a place to host documentation, enforcing rate limits, making sure the right quotas are assigned to the right person, giving you great analytics tools and so on. Basically everything you need to provide a decent API service that keeps developers and your servers happy.\nMajor differences lie mostly in implementations. While 3scale is something you use server-side and keep asking \"Hey, can this user do that? Can they? Right now? Okay!\", Mashape and Mashery work as a sort of proxy where they keep track of everything on their own end and only send requests your way when appropriate.\nOf course this means you have to conform to some sort of standard that Mashape can understand, but a really cool consequence is that they automatically create client libraries for all sorts of different platforms.

(Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nThis post is about what it means to think like an editor. You're in service of your readers, who happen to be (potential) customers of your products/services. This is how you can boost your business in the long run.\n1. Consistency\nYour corporate blog shouldn't be just a series of random posts. Rather, think of it as a coherent publication. As someone who's responsible for your company's blog, you make sure content as well as style and tone of writing are consistent throughout the blog and they reflect and communicate the values of your brand.\nTIP: Think of your blog as a coherent publication.\n2. Editorial Calendar\nAn editor plans well ahead, so he/she can make their blog a coherent publication. Editorial calendars originate in traditional print media. \"An editorial calendar is basically a fancy name for a blogging schedule,\" says Bostjan. You can't allow yourself to be in a situation when you don't have a clue what will be posted the next time or next week. You should plan content well in advance.\nTIP: Plan content well in advance.\n3. Integration\n#2 can work when your blog isn't an isolated medium among a number of other channels your company uses to communicate with their customers. Thus an editorial calendar is much more than just planning blog posts. It should include all other channels: social media, marketing campaigns, new product launches, corporate events, any speeches ... Only then will your blog make sense and only then will you be able to plan accordingly. It's about the big picture.\nTIP: Integrate your blog with other communication channels of your company.\n4. Observer\nAn editor should be well informed with the company's target audience (buyers, customers) as well as their pain points. He/she should know what's trending, even outside of their niche. \"Everything is potentially a great idea for your next post.\" Act as a harbinger of what's to come. This is how you're going to make your blog relevant.\nTIP: Observe the world around you and always be on a lookout for new ideas.\n5. Mingle\nAn editor knows where he/she can get relevant information and ideas for their blog. You should know who or what to turn to, who to talk to. You'll discover most blog ideas among the people you work with, especially among those who have direct contact with customers. Here I wrote how to talk to your coworkers to generate ideas for blog posts.\nTIP: Talk to people who can supply you with relevant blog ideas.\n6. Creativity\nA great editor also constantly thinks how to convey information or ideas to their target audience. You should make an effort to spice up your blog by using different genres, by using multimedia, etc. Of course these decisions should be based on solid knowledge of your target audience.\nTIP: Make a dynamic exciting blog.\n7. Why\nLet me quote Robert Rose: \"Our content marketing should be focused on delivering value to our audiences beyond the product or service we provide. It should ultimately answer the question of 'why' our consumers care about us.\" Always have an answer to 'why' questions: why you're writing a blog, why you're posting a text on a particular topic, etc. A great editor always knows why he made a specific decision.\nTIP:  Don't do anything unless you know why you're doing it.\n8. Measure\nAs a corporate blog editor you have to measure the effectiveness of the blog; therefore, you also have to think like a publisher and CMO. You have to make sure that your blog achieves agreed-upon goals (business, marketing goals). Then, you have to adapt according to the results. A company (hopefully) pays you for this job (yes, it is a job), so you have to make sure it brings in results.\nTIP: Measure the success and adapt accordingly.\nNext week I'll write about how to edit a blog post.\nAre you a blog editor? What other advice would you add to the 8 above?", "title": "The Art of Thinking Like a Real Blog Editor"}, {"body": "We're proud to present Jo Diaz as our Power User of the week! Jo writes juicy tales on her Wine Blog, a 2011 Best Industry Blog finalist by Wine Blog Awards. She's especially dear to us as she was one of the first Zemanta users, happy readings!\nYour life story is very interesting. After 11 years in broadcasting you are more or less still in business producing high quality content. Can you tell us more about your journey to where you're now professionally?\nAfter 11 years in broadcasting, involving PR, producing, and photographing rock and roll stars on tour, I moved to California in 1992. I segued into the wine industry, leaving one exciting career for another. I've been employed by Hambrecht Wine Group (Belvedere and Grove Street wineries), Robert Mondavi, Barefoot Cellars, Ironstone Vineyards, and Kendall-Jackson, while simultaneously working on a wine sales and marketing degree. In 2001, I launched Diaz Communications, founded the Association of African American Vintners and PS I Love You, Inc. (a Petite Sirah wine grape advocacy marketing group). I've continued to be PSILY's executive director, 10 years later. In 2011, I also founded the Oregon Pinot Gris marketing group. I produce annual events: an Oregon Pinot Gris Symposium, a Petite Sirah symposium, and Petite Sirah's Dark & Delicious wine and food event; over 60 wineries and nearly 40 restaurant... all serving Petite Sirah [dark] and foods that pair well with Petite [delicious].\nI'm published with wine writings both online and off, and a boatload of my images with rock and roll stars were published in music trade magazine at the time, Billboard, Radio and Records, and Cash Box, etc.\nAnd privately? Who is Jo?\nI'm a woman who loves to teach (I've been doing that since the late 1960s) and learn (I've been doing that since the universe started). Now I teach and learn through my wine writings... I love gardening, cooking, fine wine (and everyday wine), using my hands to create; and, I adore my family above all else.\nCan you tell us more about your love toward wine?This answer is going to surprise you, because most answers like this talk about wines aromatics, textures, and colors... the swirl, the sniff, and the sip. What I love about wine is its 8,000 year history as a civilizing beverage. I can't imagine where we'd be without it in our daily lives (in my house). It's a liquid food that is now (finally) being proven to have so many health benefits when enjoyed in moderation, that I know it was put here to be part of our daily lives. That's what I love about it... its humanity.\nDo you consider yourself a blogger?\nYes, I do consider myself a blogger.\nWhat makes someone a blogger?A blogger is someone who's writing an online Web log (Origin: 1995 - 2000;  shortening of Weblog), which is exactly what I'm doing; I'm chronicling my journey as a wine industry publicist. My days are filled with organizing, creating, photographing, writing for clients... And at the end of the day, I need to also create for myself. It gives me the freedom to not be edited. Yes!\nIsn't blogging the best thing that has happened to people like you and us, who have a lot to say and share and like to write?\nAbsolutely. It's such a great release to get these stories out of my head and into the universe's brain. My thoughts will live long after I do. My kids can take my writings and publish them, if they wanted to... More importantly, my children will be able to look back and have a piece of me each day, if they want to. I now wish I had asked my parents and grandparents so many questions. I can't do that, though. They took all of that information with them into the ether. I'm only left to wonder.\nWhat do you blog about?\nAbout 95 percent of my content is not related to my clients, and comes from the opportunities afforded to me being in the wine business. I find myself writing about some very strong opinions I've formed through not only my life's experiences, but also my experiences in the wine business, what I've learned and what I know works and doesn't work. About five percent of my content is related to my clients, however, because that too is worth publishing... like if I'm having another event, it's worth telling the world, because a lot of wine pros read my blog and might take advantage of my announcements.\nWhat made you launch a blog?\nIn 2001, I took a Web html class, to understand Web language in order to bridge our client-2-Webmaster relationships. My husband is a Webmaster, who helps with our clients' needs. In that class, I learned about Web 2.0 before it was even launched, and I got my first clue about interactivity. By 2002, I could foresee my own future on the Web. Having my own Web log would offer me a place to publish my wine related stories. I had plenty of them from being in the wine business (at that time for 13 years... now it's going on 20). As a female wine publicist, I had a unique point of view that was yet to be a voice on the Internet, so I defined it as my own. I was also inspired by Tom Wark, who ~ at the time ~ was the only male publicist blogging. In the wine business, we're now the two wine publicists with blogs that are recognized as leaders within our industry. It's an interesting place to have landed... simply because the two of us had a need to chronicle and Web 2.0 offered us a fleeting, socialnomic window of opportunity. I encouraged my husband build a Website for me, and now the rest is history.\nWhen did you start using Zemanta?\nAs soon as it was offered... I know a good thing when I see it. Having a handy resource that offers both images and other related stories is a valuable tool. Zemanta's tag system also helps search engines to find my writing. Naming my wine blog Wine Blog (I'm a marketer, did I mention that?) was essential in having search engines find my site and get me onto the first page of any search engine, regardless of the platform used to search. I consider Zemanta an important partner.\nHow does Zemanta help you blog better/easier?\nAs I write, I keep a keen eye on the right hand side of my screen, because another source for proving what I'm writing about might pop up. Also, images are there, if I need one, and I sometimes do. I mostly like to buy my photography, if I don't have my own images; my third point of reference is always Zemanta. Finally, being able to cite other stories that related to my own is valuable. The addition of small snapshot images in my further \"Related Articles\" from Zemanta is a feature I've been really enjoying, too. As my site has evolved and become content rich, so has Zemanta. I've enjoyed the relationship a lot.\nPower User Tip (please share a Zemanta tip!)\nKeep a keen eye toward the right hand side of your screen as you write your stories. It will enrich your blog's content; offering you handy images and additional proof that you're onto something valuable. Simply hovering over their text offerings, and you might find solid evidence to back up your own theories or explanations.", "title": "Zemanta Power User - Jo Diaz of Wine-Blog"}, {"body": "We're excited to introduce our newest member to the Zemanta team, Zach Eberhart!

I've been writing about some of them in the past few weeks. Virtually all tips you find online are about how to do it online.\nBut don't dismiss the offline world yet  -  what we used to call the real world. If you learn anything from content marketing, it is that it's efficient when you take advantage of all relevant tools and channels at your disposal, including the offline world. Offline promotion has been proven to be beneficial for bloggers who want to promote their blogs locally or who want to expand their reader base using offline activities.\nThis post isn't about teaching you something new or revealing an insider secret. I'd just like to remind you that offline blog promotion matters. It isn't pass\u00e9.\nOffline networking\nNetworking is a great way to promote your blog. I don't mean only via online social networks, but personally by attending networking events like conferences, especially, but not limited to those in your niche.\nYou can attend them or be a speaker. Many need some time to get to the point when they are invited by conference organizers to give a presentation, so in the meantime use conferences to establish meaningful business relationships. Mingle, talk to people; every one of them is worth your time. If they are not in the market for your services or products, they have plenty of friends who might be.\nHere at Zemanta, we tend to attend as many conferences around the world as we can. We do it in different capacities: as speakers, attendees, or sponsors. We make sure that we catch the interest of those who may have missed us online.\nConferences aren't the only offline promotion opportunities; take any opportunity to become visible to your potential readers/clients by accepting invitations to talk to a group of people that are not necessarily in your niche. Thus, we've never denied an invitation to speak to a class of students, or an association etc. It is how you can make yourselves known outside the constraints of the online world.\nBusiness Cards\nMake sure to bring business cards and whatever else you can afford (T-Shirts, pens, etc.) to make an impression on potential readers and partners. If you thought that business cards were a thing of the past  -  do you remember that iconic scene from American Psycho, when the boys were competing in who had the best business card?  -  you thought wrong.\nBusiness cards are a must. You may accidentally meet people whose interests might match with your blog's niche. If you are ready, you can give your business card and you can expect at least one visit from that person.\nBy the way, business cards are quite cheap to purchase. When you design your card, be sure to include your logo, tagline, and all your contact information. Single out your blog on your business card.\nYour goal offline should be the same as your online goal: to be as helpful and useful as possible to your (potential) readers/clients.\nDo you have any experience in promoting your blog offline?

There are two ways to do this: guest blogging and leaving valuable comments.\nGuest Blogging\nI write for two blogs: this one and my personal blog. But from time to time I also do a guest blog. One of my most popular and shared guest posts has brought a noticeable traffic to both aforementioned blogs. It made me a lot more visible.\nThis case shows that guest blogging on a blog with good ranks can be a potential boost to your SEO. The links in the author description are especially valued by Google. \"Links control the web. If you want rankings on Google, you need links. If you want authority in your niche, you need links. If you want traffic from other blogs, you need links. Guest blogging is a fairly easy way to get custom anchor-text, high quality one way backlinks to your website,\" writes Glen Allsopp aka Viperchill.\nIndeed, guest blogging helps grow your readership by getting introduced to an audience you wouldn't normally have access to. It helps you earn recognition, and even get some great links back to your blog; the latter is a primary reason why bloggers do it.\nWhatever you write for another blog must be great. It must be relevant to the audience of the blog you're a guest of. Indeed, only exceptional content is heavily shared and has huge potential value for your blog. Therefore, choose carefully what blog you're going to write a guest blog for. Understand that blog and its audience. And write a post for them! Impress that blog's readers. Only doing it this way you (i.e. your blog) may reap the rewards of guest blogging. Moreover, don't stick with a few chosen blogs; write guest posts for many different blogs to maximize the benefits of guest blogging.\nGuest blogging is a win-win situation for both, a guest blogger and a hosting blog. Therefore, don't just guest blog on other blogs; include guest posts on your own blog. If you play it smart, you'll get excellent, free content.\nAnd one more thing: don't just write a post, admire it when it's posted on someone else's blog and then disappear until the next one. You should always be a professional! Always respond to comments left under your guest post! This will show the readers that you are genuine and not some self-absorbed spammer.\nLeaving comments\nBecome someone to the point where many want you to leave a comment on their blog. This is how you can increase the visibility of your own blog  -  simply by being active on other people's blogs. It's about networking with other bloggers and getting introduced to readers you otherwise probably could not. This is how you share someone else's audience and attract them to your content. If your comment attracts attention by another reader they will click your link back to your site and see what you have to say. Besides, Google loves backlinks!\nAs I already pointed out, you must leave relevant and useful/helpful comments on other blogs of your interest if you want to get something out of it  -  increased flow of traffic to your blog. In addition, include relevant links in your comments, but don't exaggerate. Don't come across as just another spammer!\nThese two methods work! We know! We've increased the flow of traffic to this blog by 400 per cent in the last 6 months alone!\nDo you include guest post on your blog? Do you have any rules/guidelines for guest bloggers? What are they?", "title": "How to Increase Traffic to Your Blog, Part 3: Guest Blogging and Networking through Comments"}, {"body": "It's amazing. Absolutely unbelievable how many businesses are still bragging and not blogging.\nI'm so pretty and I want everybody to know. Will they listen?\nAsk yourself.\nWhat TV shows do you like to watch?\nWhat movies do you like to watch?\nWhat newspapers do you like to read?\nWhat magazines do you like to read?\nNow ask yourself why?\nOne reason is because they don't talk about themselves all the time.\nFirst time bloggers (and so do many veterans) though tend to do this. It's understandable. We believe in our products and services. We know they're good and helpful to our target audience. We want to make sure that they know that too. We want to let the world know that we're good and why we're good, why they should trust us.\nThese are all normal human desires. I mean, does it make sense that after all the time, energy, money and effort we put in opening business and developing products and services to not talk about them at all? After all, that's what blogs on blogging and content marketing are telling us not to do.\nIt doesn't make sense, right? You're right. But you're also wrong.\nIndeed. Based on all posts on the Internet about how and what to blog to boost your business, you may get an impression that talking about your company and its products and services is almost forbidden, unwanted, it brings bad luck, it's wrong.\nWe've been so occupied with making sure that bloggers, especially business blogs really write what their customers need, want. In the process we've forgotten to include that talking about oneself, one's business, and especially products and services, isn't 100 per cent verboten. How else can your target audience learn about them, especially if your blog is their main source of information. And can you imagine Lamborghini's blog without mentioning Lamborghinis?\nIt's about healthy balance, just like everything else in life. When losing weight (the healthy long-term way), you learn that you can eat a piece of cake from time to time. It's not like they're eternally banned from your life. No, it's about balanced diet. So, it is about balanced blogging.\nHelp your (potential) customers. Yes. But from time to time also tell them why your business, your products/services are so great. Just don't boast. Include them in interesting stories. That's all it is to it.\nFind your balance!\nHow do you include your products/services directly into your blog posts? What works best for you? Please do share!", "title": "Who Says You Should Never Talk about Yourself and Your Business?"}, {"body": "This is our 505th post. We started our business in 2007, and our first blog post was published in August that year.\nImage via CrunchBase\nAs we're in business making blogging easier, less time consuming and more fun, we've been learning a lot throughout the years. At first, we more or less wrote about ourselves; since then we've been constantly learning that what our readers and Zemanta users want from us isn't just a blogging assistant, but also useful advice on how to blog better and more effectively, especially to boost their own business. Later we learned from others and via our own experience that readers expect regular updates  -  as many as possible without compromising the quality of our posts. Hence, just in the first half of this year we've updated our blog exactly 100 times  -  an increase of 257% compared to the same period last year. And it has had an impact on traffic as well, traffic is up 400% since the beginning of the year.\nBack in 2007 and 2008 I used to blog regularly, after a while I couldn't find time for it; at the time Zemanta was without a marketing person, so basically there was no one to really push me to write.\nA year ago I even started my own blog. But as I wrote in my guest post for Content Marketing Institute last year I felt bad for not updating regularly.\n\"I felt like I really had a lot to talk about, and wanted to share my views with my readers. Moreover, as the CEO of a company that focuses on making blogging easier, I missed that feeling of joy I get when writing.\"\nThrough my recent experiences on my own personal blog and Z-blog, I've learned that blogging more regularly brings more visitors to blog and raises my own profile as well as an image of Zemanta in the industry.\nYou may say it took me a while to discover this, but we were persistent enough to get to the point when we could learn this. Overnight success does not exist. Behind each and every success story, there are years of struggle and effort until finally success is found. And only then the real battle begins.\nMy point is: be persistent! Don't give up too early, too easily! Observe what's happening with your blog and adapt! Update regularly! And once again, don't give up! Remember: being persistent and consistent signals more than passion; it signals belief  -  a recipe for a successful blog!\nDo you agree? How long did it take you to reap the reward of blogging?", "title": "Why Giving Up Is Not an Option or Persistency Pays Off"}, {"body": "Is It Time to Get Mad?\nShould I write provocative blog posts? This is a question that we hear a lot from entrepreneurs who are either just starting to blog or searching for a way to rejuvenate their blogging spirit. At first blush, adopting an edgy writing style sounds like an effective way to spice up ordinary business topics. However, there are risks.\nI remember hearing Brian Clark talk about this at a SOBCon meeting a few years ago. He said that creating a controversial personal brand was perhaps the best marketing strategy of all ... but it wasn't for him. He admitted he just didn't have the personality for it.\nThis struck me as exceedingly sound advice. The worst thing you can do as a blogger is try to be something you're not. If by nature you are controversial, rude, and/or flamboyant, by all means consider a take-no-prisoners content strategy. However, if you are not that sort of person, a confrontational writing style is bound to come off poorly.\nAnother necessity for provocative blogging is that you must be passionate about your topic. One of my favorite SEO bloggers is Michael Martinez. He can be a little out there at times, but whether you agree or disagree with him, you can never question his utter dedication to SEO. It makes him worth listening to.\nAnother critical factor is the nature of your niche. SEO, for instance, has writers of all stripes, from farmers to fanatics. In order to learn anything, you have to be willing to give writers a wide berth. On the other hand, if you're a company like BluePay, which is a financial services business, the last thing you want is to be perceived as a fanatic.\nHow to Go Berserk Nicely\nIf, after all of these cautionary remarks, you still want to push the envelope, here are a few ideas to help you be constructively provocative, as opposed to a mere rabble rouser.\nAll caps and multiple exclamation points make you annoying, not provocative.\nGood envelope pushers are pushing most of the time. If your writing has massive mood swings, you'll make readers uncomfortable.\nHumor is a good way to take the sting out of a sharp point of view. It keeps people from taking your criticism personally.\nGood envelope pushers pick their spots. It'll be better to flame out about something, as opposed to flaming out about nothing.\nGood envelope pushers have a consistent point of view. You know what Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern are going to say before you even tune in  -  but this makes them more popular with their fans, not less.\nGood envelope pushers are willing to lose big chunks of the audience. This was another point Brian Clark stressed. Most businesses don't have the courage do do this ... and perhaps, justifiably so.\nGood envelope pushers have thick skin; they not only invite harsh criticism, they seem to thrive on it.\nGood envelope pushers are shrewd business people. If you don't think there's method behind Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern's madness, you are too naive to be a provocative blogger!\nCase Study in Progress\nHarrison Jones, a Straight North SEO specialist with a sideline Chicago food blog, is in the midst of a test to see what kind of results he can get from in-your-face blogging. He recently wrote a post entitled, Why US Cellular Has Better Food than Wrigley  -  sure to provoke a bloodbath between fans of the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox, one of the fiercest intra-city sports rivalries in the world. Harrison, a White Sox fan, writes in the following vein:\n\"Attending a Cubs game is like watching a 3\u00bd hour disaster with nasty beer and shitty food. Unlike the Cubs, the White Sox pride themselves on food at US Cellular Field.

He is a co-founder of Fieldoo  -  Sports Career Network, which is just about to be launched!  Happy readings!\nWho is Jure?\nI'm just a regular guy who first of all enjoys his life! To quote my Twitter bio: sports, marketing & content guy who loves to travel, and a huge fan of soccer & FC Barcelona (I lived in Barcelona for a year!). I enjoy hanging out with friends and I'm married to a beautiful girl who brings joy and balance into my life.\nWhat attracts you to sports marketing? How did you get into this business?\nI come from a sports family, so sports has always been an important part of my life. When I was a kid I dreamt of becoming a professional soccer player. I couldn't make it as a pro-athlete but I found out I could be deeply involved in sports from a different perspective, through sports marketing. Sport in general has a universal appeal and is driven by passion, emotions, intensity, dynamics... As such, it is a great starting point for different activities around it and this is roughly called sports marketing. How it all started? I went to Barcelona for post-degree studies of sports marketing and since then I've been involved in it all the time. And I love it!\nWhat do you blog about?\nSince Fieldoo.com is the online network of soccer professionals from around the world, created for best interaction between athletes, sports agents, scouts and others, I obviously blog about sports related content: sport careers, media, marketing, social networks and other fields which can  -  hopefully  -  be helpful and bring added value to our readers. We're always trying to offer a wider view of certain topics.\nWhat made you launch a blog?\nOur content is one of the main pillars of the whole concept of Fieldoo and lends credibility and relevance to our core product  -  Fieldoo itself! We do believe a blog is also a great way to give advice if needed, share ideas, stories, and examples with our readers (existing & potential users). We're lucky to have a background in the sports industry which is very passionate, emotional and constantly provides interesting content and exciting stories... Those things have to be recorded somehow and a blog is just a great way to do it. So, launching a blog was kind of a natural thing for us. There are also other impacts of blogging, such as attracting search engine traffic, creating a community and maintaining a close relationship with your readers...\nDo you consider yourself a blogger? If yes, what makes someone a blogger?\nYes, I do; at the same time I also consider myself a publisher, journalist, editor, content curator... I think the boundaries between these concepts are nowadays getting fuzzy so you have to be multitasking and cover all those fields instantly if you want to stay up to date and constantly provide quality content. Well, what makes someone a blogger? That can be a rhetorical question but above all, a blogger  -  at least in my opinion  -  must have an affinity for writing, a sense of critical review, and a social touch.\nWhen did you start using Zemanta?\nI tried Zemanta's demo version a few years ago but I started to use it regularly earlier this year. When I saw one of Zemanta's presentations on why and how to use it, I finally decided to give it a shot. And I have to say, it was a great move to start using Zemanta!\nHow does Zemanta help you blog better/easier?\nI'm impressed with suggested images and related articles! I have no more problems with image rights and I don't search around anymore to find appropriate photos. It's all here in one place within WordPress. I also like related articles that offer a greater context for certain blog posts and access to others' opinions on a related topic. All the tools Zemanta provides are helpful and can make your (blogging) life easier and more carefree.\nPlease share a Zemanta tip!\nDon't be afraid  -  like I used to be  -  to use external links and give credit to good stuff on the web. Instead of being an isolated island, try to think out of the box  -  \"sharing is caring\". If you respect (i.e. link) others, others will respect (i.e. link back) you as well. It's that simple. You get what you give.", "title": "Zemanta Power User - Jure Doler of Fieldoo"}, {"body": "Over 345 million people view more than 2.5 billion blog pages each month on WordPress alone. WordPress.com users produce about 500,000 new posts and 400,000 new comments on an average day.\n66 percent of WordPress blogs are written in English, followed by blogs written in Spanish (8.7 per cent), and Portuguese in 3rd. (6.5 per cent).\nWho says English is the only blogging language?\nThe first instinct would be to blog in English. There is a global audience at your disposal. There's a better chance your blog would be read by thousands and thousands if not even millions of readers around the world if you blog in English.\nTo be adorned by so many!\nBlogging, however, doesn't guarantee millions of readers of your blog, if only it were that easy!\nCheck out the numbers above again! Only on WordPress.com blogs, there are about half a million new posts per day! Two thirds of those are written in English!\nWhat niche can you cover to be noticed? What different perspective do you bring that more and more readers would eventually notice you in this jungle of thousands of posts?\nYour first question shouldn't be, \"What language should I use for my blog?\" Rather, it should be: \"Why do I want to blog? What am I trying to achieve?\"\nContent and goals should be addressed first and then focus on which language to use.\nIf you'd like to reach an audience beyond your own country and give a perspective not available outside your country, write in English or other popular languages like Spanish.\nBecause English is a globally spoken language, surely there will be more blogs in your niche, so it will be harder to get a piece of cake. You'll have to put a lot more effort than it's even possible to achieve any of your business goals in an overcrowded English blogging jungle.\nWhy not think differently? There may already be (most likely are) many interesting blogs and websites about the topics you're interested in and would like to write about, but the options in your native language are not so great; the most sensible thing would to blog in your native language.\nFor example, I write my own blog on customer media in Slovene. There are only 2 million Slovenians! And not many are interested in the topic I cover in my blog.\nI decided to write in Slovene for a very very small audience, because I wanted to position myself as a leading expert in the field in my home country. It's how I'm getting jobs. I knew that there were plenty of blogs and websites on the issue I'm writing about in English. At the time I didn't feel I could bring something revolutionary new to the table, but I could make a difference in my native language, because I'd be one of the first. Those that read my blog regularly are my valued target audience. I bring great useful content that is otherwise only found in English and written mostly for the North American and UK markets. I feel that I'm contributing.\nMichael Schuermann of Easy Hiker once wrote, English is the language of the Internet. \"If you are the monoglot citizen of a country like Denmark, you are - through no fault of your own - restricted to an audience the size of metropolitan San Francisco. Even for the native speakers of a major European language such as German, English is the only available ticket to a global readership. This is why virtually everybody nowadays blogs in English.\"\nBut it's the quality of your readers that matters. It's the goals that you want to achieve by writing a blog that matters.\nWhen you know why you're blogging, what you can contribute to the conversation or whether you can start a new one, when you know all this, then it's going to be much easier to decide what language you should write your blog in.\nDo you blog in English or in your native language? How did you make a decision?", "title": "Dilemma: To Write in English or Your Native Language?"}, {"body": "Do you link? You don't? Well, you should if you want to increase traffic to your blog.\nReaders love links.  Links also give search engines a signal about the linked-to posts. Problogger Darren Rowse has already attested to this much overlooked fact: \"When I've tracked clicks on my pages I find that in content links get actual clicks at a much higher rate than the 'related posts' at the end of articles.\" Indeed, linking is common practice on the web; in a way it is expected.\nPrinciples of PageRank (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nThere are, by and large, two different \"types\" of links you should include in your posts to increase the flow of traffic to your blog: interlinks and linking out.\nInterlinks\nLast week I wrote: \"When you reference your own material ... you may draw visitors to your content.\" By including internal links strategically (definitely not randomly) throughout your post, you open the door to your other relevant and supporting posts that will get your readers deeper into your blog. This is how they'll become more interested in your blog and most likely in your business.\nZ-Blog has already 500 posts, this one is our 501st. Is there even one person who would browse through all our posts to find the ones he'd be interested in reading? Most likely there isn't. So how can you make the most of tons of pages and posts on your blog? Utilize the power of links. Referencing your previous posts (strategically, relevantly, and contextually) increases the likelihood that they will be read and not forgotten, days, weeks, or even months after they were posted online. On the other hand, you make it easier for your potential readers to find more great and relevant content on your blog; you increase the likelihood they'll keep coming back for more.\nAccording to David Reich, interlinks are also crucial for SEO \"because they help distribute PageRank ('link juice') to important pages across your site\". Furthermore, he adds, \"the anchor text used for your internal links is another strong signal that helps search engines determine what those linked pages are about\".\nBe careful though! Do not exaggerate with interlinks! You will give a spam signal to both, search engines and your potential readers.\nLinking out\nDon't just link to your previous posts, reference the content of others as well. You'll earn links and social mentions by those you reference because sooner or later they will notice you. And you want them to notice you, especially if they're well-established bloggers/authorities in their field and socially influential. According to David Reich's guest post on this blog, linking out also makes your content more credible and authoritative  -  the best way to build an audience.\nI've been following discussions against linking out for years. The most often mentioned reason has been that linking out is an invitation for your hard-to-come-by readers to leave your blog and go somewhere else  -  a one-way ticket out of your blog. Thus, instead of increasing the flow of traffic to your blog, you're basically actively encouraging the decrease in traffic. Nonsense!\nFour year ago, a survey of major newspapers on the web, for example, clearly showed that there is a strong relationship between news websites linking out and getting links in return. Therefore, linking to useful websites doesn't decrease traffic, but quite the opposite actually. Offering useful links makes visitors more likely to return to see what other interesting blogs they might find in the future.\nBlogging is basically contributing to a conversation. Penelope Trunk, who's already founded three startups, says: \"One of the great pleasures of blogging is linking to someone who I don't think knows that I read their blog. A link to someone is like saying, 'I really like what you're writing and in fact, I want to share it with everyone I know.' A blogger trades on ideas, so recognizing another blogger's ideas with a link is a big deal. And it's so easy to do, considering how nice it makes people feel. So do it.\"\nWhat is your experience with adding links in your post? Do you reference your previous posts or do you link to other blogs or both? What brings you more traffic?", "title": "How to Increase Traffic to Your Blog, Part 2: Link Like Crazy (Well, not too Crazy)"}, {"body": "We're proud to present Michele Linn, editorial director at Content Marketing Institute (CMI). She oversees all of the content that CMI creates; she decides what kind of content they should run, and then she works with CMI internal team as well as freelancers to get this done. When CMI launched in May 2010, Michele was managing the blog, \"But it's quite time-consuming to coordinate all of our authors and posts, so we hired a dedicated person.\" CMI blog is now run by Jodi Harris, CMI's editorial content manager.\nMichele, do you approach writing for and editing a blog differently then you would any other communication channel content needs to be distributed via?\nI think writing for a blog is different than writing for other mediums. For instance, here are some of the ways I would approach writing for a blog differently than writing for print:\nWhen writing for print, you can be more clever with your headlines as that is not necessarily the thing that is drawing the reader in (think images and call outs). But, with blogging, the headline is essential as that is something that is often socially shared. Instead of choosing something clever, it's more important to have a title that includes keywords your potential audience is monitoring and something straightforward so people quickly know what they will be learning.\nWith blogging is that you need to write in a way that makes it easy for readers to skim. Headers and bolding key points really helps. In magazines, you can often use callouts and different text treatment.\nBlogging is so immediate so you can cover topics that are trending. This is a bit more difficult with print becasue of the long production times.\nIt's easier to include more interactive elements in blog posts than it is in print. Of course, it's a good idea to include internal and external links in blog posts, which is something you can not easily do in print.\nWhat can you tell us about the whole process from idea to post to promotion?\nOur process for publishing our daily blog has evolved over the past two years. To answer your questions specifically:\nRecruiting bloggers: When the blog launched, we were actively recruiting bloggers we had relationships with to write for us. Once our blog and brand became more established, we have had a steady stream of writers reach out to us to ask about blogging. (For the record, we welcome new writers to our blog; check out our guidelines.) Jodi and I also actively follow other blogs in the industry, and we'll reach out to people as well. We also have contributors who write for us regularly.\nThe editing process: Most of our authors submit posts to us via Word docs that we edit. While we edit for grammar, we also edit for logic, flow and cohesion. We also want to make sure the author is clearly driving at a point that readers can actively \"do\" to improve some aspect of their content marketing program. We use the commenting feature of Word to communicate questions and thoughts about the post. We then return a \"clean copy\" of the post to the author with comments, and the review continues.  New authors may be surprised at the level of edits we provide, but we have had a lot of positive feedback about the approach.\nPromotion: In addition to whatever promotion the author does, we promote our posts via our corporate Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook accounts.  Our team is also encouraged to socially share as well. To increase the life of our posts, I'm working on a number of ideas to help our readers better find posts on topics that interest them.\nWhat is a great blog post?\nThis is a tough question to answer because it depends on your goals. For CMI, great posts are those that people actually use to help them with their content marketing.  For instance, Brody Dorland wrote this post about 12 things to do after you've written a blog post that I know our readers have followed (I have as well).  Our readers also love templates that walk them through a process. Our post about 10 must-have templates for content marketers has been one of the most popular posts we have published.\nDo you consider yourself a blogger? If yes, what makes someone a blogger?\nEven though I don't have a solo blog, I definitely consider myself a blogger as I write regularly for CMI and Savvy B2B Marketing (and I used to write for others when I had a bit more time). I think anyone who regularly blogs is a blogger.\nHow did you start blogging? And why?\nI started blogging in March 2009. Very long story short, I connected with some fellow freelance writers at an online conference, and we decided to start a blog about B2B marketing for our prospective clients. Savvy B2B Marketing was born.\nAs a writer, I was interested in blogging, but I didn't know how to get started. Being part of a collaborative blog was one of the best things I did to help my business as I learned the basics of blogging basics and social sharing. And, because there are six of us, we have always shared the load and our expertise.\nThen, when I connected with Joe Pulizzi and he asked me to help him launch the Content Marketing Institute two years ago, I had the experience on how to run a collaborative blog. Of course, I have learned much since!\nCan you share any blogging tips?\nHave a focus: If you are a business blog, be clear about what your readers will get from your content and stay focused. For instance, at CMI, all of our posts have a how-to element about them.\nHave an editorial calendar: Blogging is A LOT of work, and if you want to be consistent, you need a plan.  An editorial calendar not only helps keep you on a schedule, but it also helps you keep track of your ideas.\nBe a guest: If you are new to blogging, start by submitting guest posts to blogs so you can get a feel for the process and time commitment. My guess is that you are underestimating the time it will take to maintain a consistent blog.\nGet help: Writing a blog can be grueling as the pressure to create never stops. This is even true when you have other writing the posts as we do on CMI. At the very least, get someone who can review your posts for typos.

Problogger\nProBlogger is one of the most linked-to blogs on blogging. The man behind it is Darren Rowse, an Australian living in Melbourne. He posts really helpful tips on blogging, from the simplest to the most complex ones, tips that we need to be reminded of from time to time. He's thorough and his texts are easy-to read. He's been blogging for ten years now, so he knows what he's talking about.\n2.

It is full of industry tips on how to do content marketing right and boost your business. They update their blog twice a day; they don't always post about blogging, but blogging is presented as an integral part of your entire content marketing strategy.\n3. The Sales Lion\nThis is one of my favorite blogs. When reading it, I learn and I laugh  -  is there anything better than having fun while learning new things? Marcus Sheridan started a swimming pool company in 2001. Thanks to his blog, it grew to be one of the biggest companies of its kind in the world. Now he only teaches about stuff he's personally experienced. He's straight forward and tells it like it is. Refreshing and really helpful!\n4. Copyblogger\nCopyblogger was founded in January 2006 by Brian Clark who built three successful offline businesses before moving to a completely online business model. The Guardian has named his blog on blogging, one of the world's 50 most powerful blogs, which is one of many accolades he's received in the past 6 years. Copyblogger is updated daily and it looks at writing from even the craziest viewpoints like a post titled The 7 Bad Habits of Insanely Productive People.\n5.

Please do share!", "title": "5 Blogs You Can't Live Without"}, {"body": "Just because you have the most relevant blog for your audience ever, it doesn't mean you can expect high volume traffic. It takes more than great relevant content to steadily increase traffic to your blog and boost your business. It helps to know your target audience, to post high quality and relevant content, to share your content via social media, to post regularly etc.\nBut what else can you do to increase blog traffic? I've compiled a list of 5 additional tactics to increase the flow of traffic to your blog. This post is an introduction to an in-depth discussion of each and every tactic you can expect from me in the next few weeks.\n1.  Reference your previous posts and posts by others\nThere's been a short period of time when \"experts\" were discussing whether it is good to add links to other content in your posts. I think that discussion has slowly dissipated. A reason was that readers simply love links. When you reference your own material, as I did in this post's introduction, you may draw visitors to your content. Just be careful and don't manipulate or, even worse, exaggerate. Links also give search engines a signal about the linked-to posts.\nDon't just link to your previous posts, reference the content of others. You'll earn links and social mentions by those you reference. Many bloggers are subscribed to Google Alerts service and regularly check to see who's talking about them and what they're saying.\n2. Be active on others' blogs\nA couple of months ago I wrote: \"I see comments the same way as I see posts: they continue/contribute to a conversation. This is how I define a quality comment. They're really hard to come by, but when they come, grab them and join the conversation.\" Moreover, you can leave relevant and useful comments on other blogs that are in your interest. Become someone to the point where everybody wants you to leave a comment on their blog. This is how you can increase the visibility of your own blog  -  simply by being active on other people's blogs.\n3. Guest Blogging\nThis one is a no brainer. Guest blogging is a great way to spread your brand to those who've never heard of you before. This will drive direct traffic to your blog that you may otherwise never get. Invite well-established bloggers to write a guest post for your blog. And do everything necessary to be invited to guest post on other blogs; as many times as possible. When you guest post on someone else's blog, don't forget to include tactic number one: include links back to your own blog. Always reply to each comment left on your guest post.\n4. Attend events in your industry\nOnline tricks and promotion of your blog aren't enough. The offline world still matters. F2F meetings are terribly useful for bloggers seeking to grow their traffic and influence. The people you meet and connect with in real-world settings are far more likely to lead to discussions about your blog and ways you can help each other. In addition, add your blog's URL to your email signature and business cards.\n5. Images are powerful\nImages are great complements to blogs  -  this is how you can produce natural SEO for your content and can give off a great interpretation to an article. People often use the image search options offered by Google and other search engines.\nWhat other tactics work for your blog?

He recently organized Startup Iceland, the first conference there celebrating entrepreneurship and startups. Its goal was to build a sustainable startup ecosystem in Iceland.\nWho is Bala?\nBala is just a guy trying to do the right thing every single day. I am a husband, father, son, brother, friend, value creator, Icelandic financial collapse survivor, investor, entrepreneur, consultant, 7-times marathon runner, blogger, principle centered human being, an Indian, Rotarian, economist, goofball, Ayn Rand fan...\nWhat do you blog about?\nI blog about entrepreneurship, startups and building sustainable businesses.\nWhat made you launch a blog?\nJust the need to get my voice heard. Anyone can make their voice heard, and I noticed that no one was blogging in Iceland in English about the startup community or entrepreneurship. I wanted the stories of Icelandic startups to be heard, so I started blogging and then it became a daily routine. I didn't launch officially or anything like that.\nDo you consider yourself a blogger? If yes, what makes someone a blogger?\nI don't know what that means. I have opinions about things and I am passionate about what I write; it's usually more than 140 characters and more than what I can write in a comment section on many social media sites. I've been writing since 2004. I've always been intrigued about trying new technologies, especially on the Internet; so when blogging or weblogging appeared I signed up with Blogger.com and started writing about everything under the sun. I was not very disciplined about writing or blogging until about six months ago. I don't know if I'd consider myself a blogger, but I want to write and blogging platforms have become very simple to use; tools like Zemanta make it fun to write and link to information that you're writing about.\nWhen did you start using Zemanta?\nI don't know the exact date, but I think I noticed Fred Wilson mention Zemanta in his blog so I wanted to try and see if it could be useful to me. I found it is very useful and it's making my blogging experience fun, so I've stuck with it.\nHow does Zemanta help you blog better/easier?\nWell, for starters it helps me get linked to things relevant to what I am writing about. It's very easy to link and also to include pictures etc. I remember originally, I used to go search for relevant images to put into my blog post but after I started using Zemanta, all that was a breeze. I also like Zemanta's related articles feature; it provides some additional information to what I write about.\nPlease, share a Zemanta tip!\nI always try to ensure the links provided by Zemanta refer to the context of what I am writing about. I know that it is easy to use, but it is the blogger's responsibility to make sure that the links provided by Zemanta are in the right context for the blog post. I always try to include pictures and related news or other blogs as part of every post. The only power tip is make sure you have the Zemanta plugin for the blogging platform set up right so it does what it was originally intended to do.\nYour life story is also very interesting. An Indian living in Iceland? Why did you move to Iceland of all places?\nIt's interesting that anyone will find my life story interesting. I fell in love with an Icelandic woman and that changed everything. I moved to Iceland because of my wife and daughter. I really didn't have any time to enjoy the people and relationships around me, because I was too busy serving my clients. We also wanted to live close to at least one of our families. We used to live in Houston, Texas and it was very far away from my family in India and it was as half as far away from my wife's family. It takes a village to raise a child and we never found that village in Houston, so we decided to move to Reykjavik, Iceland, close to my wife's family.\nI also had a serendipitous meeting with my former boss and my friend, who was a CEO of one of the Icelandic banks. We were both in Greece cheering the Icelandic handball team in the Olympics in 2004. I was there because my brother-in-law was a member of the team; my former boss was there because his bank was a major sponsor of the Icelandic Olympic team. We talked and he wanted me to join them in Iceland. We packed our bags and moved and have never looked back.\nHow much is Iceland different from the place where you grew up? What are the similarities?\nIceland is dramatically different than from where I grew up. I grew up in Chennai, Tamil Nadu India. Chennai has a population of 5 million people compared to Iceland's 321,000. I was in Iceland when the 300,000th baby was born. That was pretty awesome.\nI grew in a crowded, noisy and dusty city compared to Iceland that is sparsely populated. On the other hand, a family is very important in both countries. Indian families are close-knit and so are Icelandic families.", "title": "Zemanta Power User - Bala Kamallakharan of CLARA"}, {"body": "Posting frequently and regularly is a necessary ingredient of a successful blog. It's one of qualities that separates A-list bloggers from the rest of us.\nSo how can you post more often without compromising quality?\nIn this post I will identify best examples of post types (as defined by ProBlogger), checklists on how to get there and best tools to help you succeed.\nWe'll focus on three types of blog posts, as examples of great posts that work, case study posts, how-to posts and list posts.\n1. Case Study Posts\nCase Study type blog posts are a fantastic way to showcase how your customers are using your products or services and winning as a result of that. For this particular type, I will use an example of a case study done by Conversion Rate Experts on the work they did with SEOmoz.\nUse Customers' Own Words\nWho can tell a better story than your own customers who are using your products on a daily basis. Let me show show their enthusiasm in a testimonial, particularly if you can capture it on video.\nUse Visuals\nReaders are drawn to visuals, so make your point and show results with graphs of statistics, photos of products/service in use and video testimonials.\nDon't skimp on the Headline\nIn a succinct title describe why your readers should care about your case study and make sure that they won't feel disappointed or tricked.\nShow Real Examples\nShare the gritty details, what were the conversion rates, what was the ROI, how much money did your customer save by using your product vs. product X.\nCase Study Post Checklist:\nSo to summarize, for Case Study type blog posts, you should consider the following:\nUse Customers' Own Words\nUse Visuals\nDon't Skimp on the Headline\nShow Real Examples\n2. How-To Posts\nHow-to posts can be an easy way to showcase your domain expertise. It can be related to your offerings or an internal process, anything that shows that you are the expert and the one that your prospects should be spending money with. I've used a humorous example for this one, but it gets the point across just as well.\nConcise Introduction\nProve to your readers why you are an expert and why they should consider reading this post.\nClear Steps\nProvide a numbered, well formatted list of steps, ideally with visual cues for each point.\nInclude Examples\nFor each step, try to provide specific examples so that they readers can relate to the points.\nSolid Conclusion\nShow what your readers will get in return if they follow your steps.\nHow-To Post Checklist:\nConcise Introduction\nClear Steps\nInclude Examples\nSolid Conclusion\n3. List Posts\nSome folks think that list posts are a copout if you can't think of anything better to do, but if done right, they can be a great resource tool for your readers and great linkbait if the list struck a chord with your readers. Here's a great example from our friends at HubSpot.\nStay close to your subject/title\nDon't stray away from your subject or your readers will quickly lose interest.\nNumbers (only post good stuff, number the list so the readers can easily find their place)\nDon't shoot yourself in the food by starting out with a number to reach (top 10.. best 15 tools), if you can't find #8, #9, or #10 and provide fluff just to reach the magic number. Using numbered lists also helps your reader find their place back on the list vs. bullets.\nUse category buckets\nSplit up your lists in categories if they are getting too cumbersome\nTake formatting into account\nFormatting is crucial so that the users can follow the list without getting overwhelmed. If it looks too funky to you, go back and clean it up.\nList Post Checklist:\nStay close to your subject/title\nNumbers (only post good stuff, number the list so the readers can easily find their place)\nUse category buckets\nTake formatting into account\nTools to help with frequency\nWhy is it important to publish regularly and frequently? Here are some quick points:\nCreates a comfort level with your readers\nIncreases a recall of your blog name (as well as your brand name)\nIt acts as basis for social media engagement\nHere is a list of tools that can help publish more frequently:\nBlogSpire  -  Give us a list blogs on topics that you want to write about, and we'll give you daily output of topics and articles you should be writing about, seamlessly connected to your blog.\nEditorial Calendar  -  You can use something as simple as a Google Docs spreasheet or use more powerful tools. At Zemanta, we particularly like Edit Flow, a very robust plugin for WordPress that is action-packed.\nTools that help you spend less time per post\nHere are some quick points on what makes a great post:\nWriting  -  You can get help with inspiration, but until Siri gets more fancy, you're still stuck with writing the post yourself!\nDecorating  -  Adding images tremendously increases engagement with content. (link to our page)\nConnecting  -  Don't blog in a vacuum, validate your points with external content. It's also a great way to get noticed!\nTagging  -  Important for SEO as well as for user discovery. Particularly important on specific platforms, such as WordPress.com\nAnd here are tools that will help you get there more quickly:\nZemanta Blogging Assistant  -  Use our AI robot to enhance your posts by adding images, links to external content\nInboundWriter  -  Search engine optimization\nWordy.com  -  Professional copy editing\nAfterTheDeadline  -  Basic Spell and Grammar checker\nHope this provided a good overview of what it takes to speed up your blogging and make it more consistent.

Due to overwhelming positive feedback and popular demand, I compiled a new list of 5 sources that are very useful to bloggers. Some of them are also really cool.\n1. Voicebunny  -  fast and professional voiceovers\nDo your readers prefer listening to podcasts than reading a text? Then this tool is perfect for you. A new startup Voicebunny makes it easy to get voiceovers in minutes from a pool of 100,000 voice talents. And this is not only for texts in English; more than 50 languages are supported. Connecting to the VoiceBunny API turns blogs into podcasts automatically and in just minutes after it's posted.\n2. Wildfire  -  social media monitor\nWildfire is a startup focused on creating interactive promotions on social sites. Last year, they launched Social Media Monitor, a tool that tracks and compares how brands are performing on Facebook and Twitter. Wildfire allows bloggers to create their own branded interactive campaigns  -  including contests, giveaways, incentive-based surveys and sweepstakes  -  and to simultaneously publish them in multiple social networks and on their websites.\n3. EuroTermBank  -  EU terminology assistant\nThe EuroTermBank is a very helpful tool especially for European bloggers. If you want to check the correct term, consult the EuroTermBank. It is a project that focuses on harmonization and consolidation of terminology work in new EU member states. It's basically a useful centralized online terminology bank for languages of new EU member countries interlinked to other terminology banks and resources.\n4. Windows Live Writer  -  desktop blog application\nWindows Live is a set of free services including Hotmail and Messenger. It also includes Windows Live Writer that lets you publish to many blog services, including Windows Live, WordPress, Blogger, LiveJournal, TypePad and many more. It can even help you set up a blog. With Writer you can compose your blog entries offline and publish at a later date.\n5. Google Blog Search  -  use it till it lasts\nWould you like to know if your blog is getting any attention on Google? Google provides a service called Google Blog Search. It will allow you to put your blog URL into its search engine. Every time someone shows your material on their site you get a backlink. The backlink does two things for you. It may get people to your site but just as important it tells Google that people have an interest in your site. When Google sees that your site starts to move up in the search engine rankings.

It used to be a primary tool of how humanity transferred knowledge through generations. These days it's spread over many mediums. Douglas Coupland wrote about storytelling in an interesting, dreamy way in his book Generation A:\n\"How can we be alive and not wonder about the stories we knit together this place we call the world? Without stories our universe is merely rocks and clouds and lava and blackness. It's a village scraped raw by warm waters leaving not a trace of what existed before.\"\n-  Douglas Coupland, Generation A\nInstagram in Zemanta\nAll our registered users can now connect their account with Instagram and get their latest images in My Sources in the widget. This is cool for many reasons.  Instagram is storytelling just as much as blogging is.\nDo you ever wake up and check your Instagram feed and feel a connection to the city you live in? It's like the outside world unfolded right there in your bed. We like what we see and we document it. We share what we like. We are closer to each other this way. We don't take pictures of things for no reason, each and every photo has a distinct story behind it, an occurance that we need to share as humans to grow as people. This is why we feel this is an important step.\nWe don't just want to be a tool that helps you enrich your blog posts. We expect you to tick when you see your own photos, we want you to feel the urge to blog about your story, because storytelling is crucial. It's the very essence of blogging and writing in general. When we tell stories we make attempts in making sense of the unexplainable  -  and this is what it's all about.\nSo if you have an Instagram account, please add it to your My Sources and let us know how it works!", "title": "Storytelling with Zemanta and Instagram"}, {"body": "Oh, the white empty space. Staring at your computer screen. Is there anything worse? I'm sure this happens to all of us, the organized or disorganized. \"What should I write about?\" How can you avoid the nightmare of trying to come up with a great idea for your next post at a moment's notice?\nThe blogger's worst nightmare? (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n1. Write down ideas immediately\nI know you've heard and read this tip so many times. But it's still the best tip for this kind of situation out there. As soon as an idea pops into your head, no matter where you are, write it down. Bostjan and Michele Linn suggest an Evernote app. I still use Post-its. They're all over my desk even next to my bed. Whenever I went to bed, I seemed to relax so much I was suddenly coming up with many ideas I had been working hard to get them during the busy day. Just before falling asleep, in the dark, I seem to be most creative. There's now a pencil and lots of Post-its nearby. In my backpack that I carry everywhere, there's a pencil attached to a notebook. When I read, hear, or see something and come up with an idea I write it down immediately. It helps tremendously.\n2. Let yourself be inspired\nWhatever the topic of your personal/business blog is, don't focus on it too narrowly. Anything can inspire you. Think of analogies; how a problem from a different field that isn't even closely related to yours can nevertheless be similar to what you're writing about. For example, my post on sustainable blogging was inspired by articles I read on sustainable economy.\n3. Don't be glued to your working desk\nGet away from the computer. Write somewhere else. Shut down the computer and go to your favorite caf\u00e9 or if it's nice outside go to a park and start writing.\nMy computer, for example is my typewriter, TV, radio, I read books, newspapers, and magazines on my computer, I communicate with clients, friends and family via my computer (do we really need phones anymore?). One day I realized I was creatively paralyzed by sitting at the same spot all day (save when sleeping and exercising and hanging out with friends). Sometimes we forget that laptops can work anywhere and are easy to carry around and use them wherever we want to.\n4. Type a few words\nOpen the Word document and just type something. It doesn't matter what. Let me tell you an embarrassing story. Once I blindly typed \"ass\" on the white empty Word doc. For some reason I immediately got an idea what to write about. An innocent word typed by accident triggers something in my head. A block seems to end when you start making words on a page.\n5. Just walk away\nLet's be honest, sometimes you just can't do it. Nobody's cheerful or motivated or awake all the time. Instead torturing yourself, just don't do it. The world won't stop. Your readers won't get mad or leave you if from time to time you just don't do it. I know, it sounds blasphemous. Would a proprietor close his store because his workers don't feel like working that day? Let's not compare apples and oranges.\nHowever, this can happen very rarely, don't make it a habit. It's reserved for when you really really can't do it. On the other hand, you may easily avoid such a situation if you follow guidelines on editorial calendars.\nWhat is your cure for not staring at a white empty page?

Everything was just perfect.\nExcept for a tiny detail  -  it took them six months to discover that under the right conditions something stopped working. Just flat out didn't work right.

Is a part of the system down? Someone trying to DOS us? Users getting errors? People complaining on Twitter?\nEverything.\nWhen I was there to take a look, everything suddenly went red. DANGER! DANGER!\nNo idea what was wrong, but at that moment I knew this is exactly what everything I have ever built was missing  -  a cool dashboard to tell me when I'm being an idiot.\nDANGER!\nThe perfect setup\nMaking a dashboard of all your metrics is surprisingly simple.\nLog everything you can think of\nSet up a statsd server\nTell your logging module to also push to statsd\nSet up a Graphite server\nOpen Graphite frontend in a browser\nClick a few metrics\nDashboard.\nYou can probably do a lot more if you want to, but that's basically it.\nStatsd is a \"A network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over UDP and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services (e.g., Graphite).\"\nAnd Graphite is something like Mixpanel for developers  -  it can take all sorts of time series data and draw graphs for you. Anything you can think of, Graphite can make you a graph. Even better, it can make you a whole dashboard with just a few clicks.\nMore importantly, neither service needs any configuration.

Posts on editorial calendars are mostly about why bloggers need one, how to make one, what to do with it, etc. They're mostly about how to plan blog posts in advance. Bo\u0161tjan, on the other hand, approached this question from a different perspective.This post is a reaction to his.\nBostjan Spetic, CEO, Zemanta (Photo credit: Zemanta)\nAccording to Bo\u0161tjan, an editorial calendar isn't a list of deadlines for when a post is scheduled to be published. He argues that we take this too literally and feel accomplished only when we press publish. This means that many begin to write when a post is due. It's like being back in college when most students do their assignments when they're due, rarely weeks or days earlier. Bostjan's post stresses that we shouldn't confuse a publishing deadline with writing.\nThis was a well-needed wake up call. I haven't really noticed this way of thinking in any other posts about editorial calendars. Planning isn't only about the final deadline! Bo\u0161tjan writes, \"Never hit 'publish', always 'schedule'; this way, when you have time, or when you're on a creative/writing roll, you can end up with weeks' worth of posts.\" Brilliant! I thought, that's exactly what I'm not doing. I am good at planning, catching deadlines, but I never have a pile of already written posts. I usually write when the post is scheduled to be posted online. I am though improving, especially since I wrote a post on how to snap out of being a perfectionist and become more productive.\nWhat Bo\u0161tjan says is, that yes, an editorial calendar will make you more organized. Yes, an editorial calendar will make sure you update your blog regularly. Yes, an editorial calendar doesn't hinder your creativity. Yes, an editorial calendar is the best strategy for sustainable blogging. He though adds that we shouldn't view an editorial calendar as a tool telling us when to write. This is what many of us have forgotten or haven't been aware of. The editorial calendar is not about writing, it's about publishing.\nSo the next time when you feel like writing or even get an idea for a post that isn't scheduled yet, don't just schedule it, write it right away. It's similar to when you feel like running; you don't say, \"Oh no, I usually run on Wednesdays afternoon, so I should wait.\" You wouldn't, would you?\nThat's why I think Bo\u0161tjan's post on editorial calendars is a must read for all bloggers!\nWhat is your take on what Bostjan wrote in his post on editorial calendars?

(Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nThis is a personal story about a guy  -  well, it's about me  -  from a small country of 2 million, Slovenia, who reaps the rewards of regular blogging. My experience will show that content marketing, if done right, works.It doesn't matter how big your company is, or if you're an individual, like my case, it doesn't matter where you live and work; the only thing it matters is that you do it right. There are tons of blog posts on companies and individuals who became rich or hottest experts in their field because of blogging. But these stories usually come from the USA. Can self-publishing work elsewhere? Yes, it can.\nMy story begins last summer when I quit an exciting job at an agency. I was simply burnt out. I left without a serious plan about my future. And let's not forget there's a recession all around us. Very soon I discovered that in this economy I was unemployable. I sent dozens of job applications but all to no avail. If I happened to get a response it was usually, \"You're overqualified.\" It took me quite some time to realize that being unemployable doesn't mean I have to be unemployed.\nI used to work at a content marketing agency. Thus, the first thing I did after quitting my job was setting up a blog, launching a Facebook page and becoming more active on Twitter and LinkedIn. Content marketing was already so much part of my life that I just jumped into it for my own individual needs. I did everything right: I set up an editorial calendar, I've been blogging regularly, I've been promoting my posts and posts by others on my social media profiles (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), I've been writing guest posts for other distinguished blogs, including Z-Blog. As a content aficionado, I especially careful to post relevant and high quality content. I've been positioning myself as an expert in branded content and branded media.\nI knew well that content marketing may take time before it brings tangible results. Nevertheless, I was getting frustrated. There wasn't much engagement; a final goal of content marketing is to get business, new customers and to increase the loyalty of the existing ones. You want other people to talk about your products and services  -  brand awareness is crucial. For months, however, virtually nothing really happened. I was getting bitter. On the other hand, I never stopped blogging and being active on social media (maybe because I had nothing else to do at the time).\nIn the meantime, Google Analytics and the activity on social media implied that there was an audience out there, I just wasn't sure what impact my content had on them. Although there was virtually no engagement on my blog, after a while I kept getting phone calls or emails from readers telling me that my content is very useful, thanking me for writing something about customer media honestly. I was reminded of Marcus Sheridan's story whose pool company grew to be one of the largest of its kind in the world due to content marketing efforts and his incredibly popular swimming pool blog. He also talks about how the first 6 months were frustrating, not getting virtually anything tangible out of his content marketing and blogging efforts. Today, he's a millionaire who teaches other professionals how to embrace content marketing.\nI can relate. After about 6 frustrating, scary months, it finally happened  -  I began getting phone calls and emails from potential clients. Most were direct result of my being an active blogger and active content marketer, and of my content activities on social media. Clients either contact me directly or other people, who follow me online, recommend me to people in their social and business networks. A friend told me that before when she'd recommended me for a job, she'd had hard time convincing them to hire me because they'd never heard of me. Now, she says, whenever she recommends me, they say: \"Oh, yes, we know who he is.\" All the aforementioned activities thus help me build my brand awareness among the prospects.\nRegular blogging and other content marketing activities I've been carrying out for almost a year paid off! I'm now swamped with projects (though always looking for new ones). I'm not out of the woods yet; however, my case clearly shows what great results business blogging can bring not only to corporations, but also to small businesses or even individuals like me. My advice to all those struggling like I was is: be persistent, genuine, and proactive! In addition, make sure your content is published regularly, it is relevant to your (potential) clients and is shared by you and others online and offline!\nWhat is your story?

I guess it's a human nature. It's like shopping as spending on instant gratification. We get a sense of absolute satisfaction when we finally get a hold of a product we desperately wanted. But pleasure is usually only momentary. Soon a reality checks in and we want other new things.\nGoogle Calendar (Photo credit: HRC)\nLikewise, when blogging, when you live from a post being posted on your blog until the next one is posted. You are relieved, get satisfied only when it's posted online, not so much when it's being written, or thought out or even planned ahead. I think it's very hard to build an audience or community of followers in this manner. Because blogging shouldn't be only about you, it's about them, your readers. You should see your posts as dots on a continuous line on a graph, as a planned storyline. I am talking about a big picture  -  an editorial calendar.\nPlanning helps getting more and more readers\nA lot has been said about editorial calendars lately, mostly because of the content buzz. In content marketing, it's almost impossible to get results without a content editorial calendar. It is the foundation of strategic blogging. You'd be amazed how planning goes a long way toward getting the most audience reach from your blog content.\nLet's be honest! Continually developing good content for your blog is a very difficult task. If you don't plan ahead, or write down ideas the moment you come up with, you will certainly find yourself in \"trouble\" every time it's time to post a text. \"What should I write about today?\" Even if you started your (business) blog with tons of great ideas, eventually the day will come when those ideas will run dry  -  writer's block. An editorial calendar, on the other hand, encourages blogging as a habit and makes sure you never miss another deadline.\nEditorial calendars originate in traditional print media, such as newspapers and magazines. Can you imagine an editorial board meeting just a few days before print when the editor asks everybody around: \"Ok, what should we write about in our mag this week? Any ideas?\" By planning the content of the publication in advance, publishers make sure that they consistently publish high quality articles relevant to their readers.\nIt's a small, subtle thing, but you'll be surprised at the difference it can make. I even believe that planning content ahead doesn't hinder your creativity, if that's your excuse for not having an editorial calendar. It will make your job easier with regard to writing, more enjoyable, less stressful and above all you'll see better results  -  the community of your blog getting bigger and becoming more loyal.\nDifferent methods of planning blog posts\nAn editorial calendar is basically a fancy name for a blogging schedule. There are different methods of planning your posts. The simplest is a spreadsheet, which outlines what you'd like to write about for the next two weeks/months or more. Keep in mind that an editorial calendar should be flexible. Life is unpredictable, right?\nYou don't even need to be geeky with all the gadgets and apps available. If you prefer paper, make a paper calendar. Or as mentioned above, use an electronic spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or Google Docs or Google Calendar. If you use WordPress for your blog, their WordPress Editorial Calendar Plugin can help with scheduling. There is also WinCalendar that allows you to create and customize calendars for your blog using MS Word; this one is useful if you don't have WordPress.\nAn editorial calendar allows you to blog in advance, so that the flow of content keeps going when other things in life get in the way. Thus, it can't get any simpler than following a very simple rule: never hit \"publish\", always \"schedule\"; this way, when you have time, or when you're on a creative/writing roll, you can end up with weeks' worth of posts. Your mindset will be shifted to different gratification.\nTo sum up, keeping an editorial calendar will help you become more organized. Instead of wasting time worrying about what you will write next, you will already have a schedule. However, keep in mind this should be a schedule of when your post is due to be posted on your blog, not necessarily when you should write it! Keep writing, cross posts already written and left on the Dashboard to be published as scheduled. Do not concentrate only on writing when it's due to be posted (like if you were back in school).\nWhat kind of editorial calendar works best for you?

Note: We asked Ron to write about his recent experience with using Blogspire and his unexpected spike in traffic from his recent post. Hope you enjoy it.\nI've been blogging at http://ronfeldman.wordpress.com/ since June of 2008.  However, like many bloggers, I've found it difficult to keep up with a regular practice of blogging. In early March (2012), I got lucky enough to get access to an experimental new Zemanta product  -  Blogspire. There are two key elements to Blogspire:\n1. You make a commitment to post regularly and to spend a minimum amount of time, even 10 minutes per day blogging.\n2. Zemanta sends you a personalized set of links every day at your specified time to provide inspiration of what you might want to blog about.\nSince March, I've managed to post 11 times, way higher than was average for me before, although I still aspire to do better. I really think, for me, the key to blogging more often is resisting my urge for perfectionism.\nI constantly have ideas for blog posts and I actually keep a list.  However, many of those ideas relate to current news cycles and when I don't act on them, they become irrelevant over time. On May 7th, I published a post titled Does Instagram's $1 billion sale explain the $41 million investment in Color?   Now this was an idea I had thought about for a couple of weeks, but I finally decided to sit down and write it on Sunday night May 6th.  The post probably took 20 minutes to write and edit.  I posted it early AM on the 7th.  As usual, I tweeted the link to my post, and added it to my Facebook feed.  Not unusually, I got 1 like on my Facebook post and 2 retweets from my tweet.  The one thing that was a bit out of the ordinary is that one of my Facebook friends, Sarah Ross, with a lot of friends (3,136) and followers (3,717) shared the Facebook post with her friends/followers. I didn't think a ton about it.\nThe next morning on May 8th, I woke up and looked at the WordPress app on my phone to see how many views my post had received.  I thought that I either must be too tired to focus properly or that the app was broken. It was showing that my post had received over 2,000 views the night before. Note that my next most popular post had received 189 views in total.... I checked the referral traffic and saw that almost all the traffic was coming from Hacker News.  I quickly figured out that someone (not someone I know) had posted my link to Hacker News where it got a bunch of up-votes and comments and stayed on the front page for all of the night and then into the morning.  By the time it fell off of the front page, my post had more than 5,000 views and my blog had more than 7,000 views in a two day period. I was pretty excited. Later I noticed that some traffic was also coming from WordPress.com's blogs of the day and posts of the day sites.\nI'm still not sure where the Hacker News reader discovered my blog post, but the only unusual aspect was Sarah Ross's share, so I would guess that it derived from that somehow?\nMy blog traffic has leveled off since then, but I think it was still a great win and I have a few key takeaways:\n1. Even a modest commitment to blogging more can pay off before too long.\n2. You never know which piece of content will draw in readers.\n3. Perfect is the enemy of good.

There are also internal blogs, i.e. corporate blogs aimed at the employees of an organization/company. Many corporations and other organizations now use social networking platforms as their corporate intranet. Blogs can be an integral part of the intranet.There are tons of tips out there how to start a blog, how to blog, etc., but not nearly as much about internal blogs. So, why should you company consider setting up an internal blog?\nWater cooler used to be enough, now the intranet can do magic by sharing info and engaging coworkers.\nInternal blogging as projects' support system\nBlogs are personal. Blogs aren't official (bureaucratic) documents. Blog posts are first-person, exploratory narratives. As such they are more attractive to the readers, who are thus more open to actually read them. This leads to content variety within your organization; content that is relevant to your employees. Internal blogs can therefore achieve much better awareness of your corporate culture, of your projects, future plans, etc. Think about it: you can pursue a great project, but if it's not explained adequately, it won't be adequately supported which can severely undermine its success. Internal blogging, on the other hand, can help ensure great projects receive great explanation.\nCommunity building\nFor blog to succeed it must supply the needs of its community. Their needs can be met by regularly posting relevant and engaging content, says Bo\u0161tjan. An internal blog can be a powerful (corporate) community building channel, especially in big companies. Technical or business insight posted to an internal blog can move around the company quickly. Any analysis and wisdom has potential to gain wide attention via internal blog. A blog post can easily turn into an active discussion around a topic. This helps you gauge where your coworkers stand on certain issues.\nVisibility is capital\nMoreover, internal blogs can increase your individual or your team's visibility. And you know what they say? Visibility is capital. If your company sets up an internal blog, make sure there is a wide support for it, that different departments and teams understand well its objectives and advantages to avoid a usual impression that only those who aren't busy enough at their jobs, blog. This is so wrong and unfortunately too many times keeps employees from blogging.\n(Internal) blog is a blog\nFor your internal blog to be successful, you shouldn't approach it as an \"internal\" blog, rather as any other blog we've been writing about on Z-Blog, save the target audience happen to be exclusively the employees in your company/organization. When setting up such a blog, you should consider all questions you'd consider as a \"regular\" blogger:\nWhat are the blog's objectives?\nWhat are you going to write about?\nWho will be primarily responsible (editing, proofreading, looking for authors, content ideas for posts) for the blog?\nWho will serve as primary writer?\nHow often will you update it? Etc.\nDone properly, an internal blog is good, not only for the organization, but for the bloggers as well. For example, businesses blog to show their thought leadership. They blog because blogging is ideal for publishing content that is relevant/useful to readers. The same applies to internal blogging, save the readers are exclusively the employees.\nWhat is your take on internal blogging? Would it be a great fit for your organization? Let us know in the comments below.", "title": "4 Big Reasons Why Your Company Should Set up an Internal Blog"}, {"body": "Categories and tags are both very useful blog assets, provided they are each used for their own purpose. Last week I wrote about how to choose categories for your blog: \"To keep things simple, you'll want to limit the number of categories to about five.\" Readers use categories to navigate to posts that they're interested in; on the other hand, they help bloggers make better writing decision and keep them on track. I made it clear that categories and tags are not the same thing. However, tagging is too often used for the same purposes that categories are. Only the combination of both can be quite an effective navigation tool through your blog. This post is about what tags are, how they are different from categories and how to use tags effectively.\nIf you think of categories as sections in your favorite magazine or chapters in a book, think of tags as the index of keywords you usually find at the end of a book or as keywords used in articles in scientific journals. Tags are more specific than categories and they address items you discuss in your blog post.Categories are your blog's best table of contents, whereas tags are your blog's index. By tagging a post with relevant keywords/tags, a blogger helps readers find the posts with specific information they're looking for. The thing is, rarely anyone is interested in all posts. So make sure your readers don't get discouraged by having to spend a lot of time look for posts that may be relevant to them. That's where tags come in.\n(Photo credit: dr_ed_needs_a_bicycle)\nBased on the above understanding of tags, here are 4 general tips on tagging your blog posts:\n1. Tags should be up to three words long\nA general rule is tags should be very short. How you can achieve that, it depends on the language you're writing in. In English, tags shouldn't be longer than three words. As aforementioned, they're like keywords/topics your target audience may be interested in, because you write about things that are relevant and potentially useful to them. Tags as keywords related to your blog post will also aid search engines in finding your content. For example, tags for this post are tags, categories.\n2. Use a few tags only\nDon't get overboard with the variety of tags. Tags are primarily used to help your readers find posts on the topics they're interested in quickly. Use those that are really what your post is about. For example, tags for this post could also be content marketing, better blogging, how to blog, keywords, but honestly that would be overreaching and fishing. Don't disappoint the readers, don't frustrate them with an abundance of tags.\n3. Repeat the same tags\nKnow what your readers are interested in, what topics/keywords they're looking for. Use them as tags. Don't use synonyms; choose a specific tag and use it in every post that is about that topic. Too much variety isn't a good thing in this case, quite the opposite. For example, this post could be tagged with tags, keywords, chapters, categories, indexing, writing, blogging. But what is this post really about? It is about tags and categories. It is aimed at those who are looking for tips how to use the two on their blogs. So, why would you use a chapter as a tag?\n4. Once again, tags are not categories\nDo not use names for tags that are the same as the names of your blog's categories. They don't serve the same purpose, rather tags and categories complement each other. To sum up, don't confuse your readers.\nWhat other advice would you give bloggers about tagging? What's your experience? Let us know in the comments below.", "title": "Your Blog Needs Tags: 4 Tips How to Use Them Effectively"}, {"body": "Oh, the feeling of having nothing to write about!

However, rarely do they say anything about HOW to approach those who may be the source of ideas for your blog posts.\nEngage in casual conversation to get great ideas for blog posts. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nBefore I get into that, I must stress: \"Be curious!\" Find your inner child. He/she is still in you, somewhere. Curiosity is one of the blogger's best assets. If you're curious enough, you're more aware of your surroundings. If you open yourself to stimuli from your environment, you'll be surprised how many ideas you can get for the blog. Don't be, however, alert only in your office or when doing your work or reading for your work. Anything that you do at work or in your free time, everybody you come in contact with at work or outside work is potentially a great source for blog ideas.\nYou'll find most corporate blog ideas among the people you work with, especially among those who have direct contact with customers. And here's my advice: do not approach them officially, or only when you're out of ideas for posts. Talk to them regularly. Approach them as if you were talking to a friend, or if you were their shrink. Don't come to them and say, \"I am writing a blog for our company. What is new in your department? Please give me some ideas.\" Don't make them think, because you may not extract anything genuine nor original nor useful from them. Don't make them \"work\". Talk to them! Let them complain about or praise customers, let them speak about how something is disorganized... Be their confidant(e). That is how you'll learn the most about customers and their problems. Turn those conversations into helpful blog posts.\nMy own blog is about customer magazines and branded print publications. I get most ideas from marketing directors and magazine editors who either email me or call me with questions or are looking for my opinion on how to do something.

Think of categories like sections in your favorite magazine or chapters in a how-to-do book. When I scan the table of contents in a book or magazine, I expect to get what the book is about, what articles I want to read first. Likewise, someone should be able to look at your blog's category list and understand what your blog is about. I see a blog as a type of online magazine. I won't be interested in all posts, but I don't want to waste my time looking for posts I may find relevant and useful. Categories are there to assist me finding them quickly.\nHere are 4 tips for your categories:\n1. Put them on a visible top spot\nPut your categories somewhere on the top part of your blog, where they are visible. Again, imagine your blog as if it were a magazine. Most magazines are divided into sections, which are often visible on the top corners of a page  -  those corners are the most visible parts of every page in a magazine.\nLikewise, check out several other blogs. There is a reason why blog templates include space for categories on the very top or near the top of the page.\nCheck out categories on top right corner.\n2.    Categories should be fewer in number\nTo keep things simple, you'll want to limit the number of categories to about five; at least at first. You will always have an opportunity to make appropriate changes later on. A limited number of categories is not just user-friendly, it makes your job easier. It helps you organize your posts, like filing documents  -  the longer your list of categories, the harder it is to file and find posts  -  and it helps you think about how to approach a post on a particular topic. My personal blog for example has 6 categories.\nCategories on my personal blog are always on the top left corner.\n3.  Categories should be planned ahead\nWhat I'm getting at here is you must understand your own blog. Why are you writing it, what do you aim to achieve and, especially, what is it about? A good plan will help you define categories more clearly. Clearly defined categories help users find content quickly. In addition, categories help keep you on message. Besides, categories get indexed by the search engines. Therefore, it pays to choose them carefully.\n4. Category names should be broader in meaning\nMake sure your category names are understood without the reader having to click on them to figure out what they might mean. On the other hand, try not to be too specific. Too specific categories may lead to categories with only one or two posts, which make them useless.\nEach category should pertain to one and only one subject. Moreover, make sure that a post belongs in one and only one category. All of the above makes your blog clearer, easy to navigate through, easy to understand your overall message and story, and helps you make better writing decisions.\nTo sum up, readers who come to your blog for the first time are likely to use categories to navigate to posts that they're interested in. On the other hand, categories help bloggers make better writing decision and keep them on track.\nHow did you come up with the categories for your blog? How useful do you find them as a reader of other blogs? Let us know in the comments below.", "title": "Your Blog Needs Categories: 4 Tips How to Choose Them"}, {"body": "Writer's Block?\nDo you ever get stuck for a blog post topic? When writer's block hits me, I often look to my old friend Twitter, which can be a great resource for coming up with new things to writ about. Here are a few ways to use Twitter (in conjunction with HootSuite) for topic generation:\nCheck out your streams and see what posts are hot (i.e., getting a lot of retweets). Read these posts carefully and see if you can add anything to the topic  -  a new spin, a deep insight, elaboration of one or two key points.\nSet up keyword tracking streams to follow Twitter-wide commentary on themes you like to write about. From time to time people will share content you'd never find in your follower streams that will inspire a post idea. You'll also see conversation from fresh perspectives, which also helps you develop fresh ideas.\nTake part in Twitter chats. These forums are spectacular opportunities to share ideas with experts. Sometimes 10 or 15 questions will come up in a single chat that would each make for a tremendous post topic.\nAsk your followers! Let people know you're stuck for a topic  -  you may be surprised at how many good ideas people will serve up.\nScrutinize the streams of your favorite thought leaders. How often do you go back and read someone's entire day's or week's worth of tweets? Most of us think of Twitter as a \"now\" medium, but the archives are chock-full of topic ideas ... just waiting for enterprising bloggers to find.\nTo make Twitter work really well for topic generation, it's exceedingly helpful to optimize your Twitter presence, so here are a few Twitter tuneup techniques:\nGet rid of your spam followers. The cleaner your stream, the easier it is to pinpoint quality tweets that lend themselves to fresh topics for your blog. If you're looking for a good tool to take care of this job quickly and efficiently, try Twit Cleaner.\nSet up separate streams based on a follow's area of expertise. Ideally, you can organize streams based on your own blog topics. Twitter Lists can also be used efficiently in this way, or use both: create Lists and view them as streams in HootSuite. The key is to organize Twitter content in a way that produces a constant flow of new post ideas.\nFavorite tweets to archive great ideas you don't have time to ponder at the moment. Again, getting caught up in the immediacy of Twitter can sometimes blind us to the long-term value of its content. If you run across a Tweet with a brilliant idea or link, save it as a Favorite, and study it at your leisure, perhaps in front of a fire as you sip a fine brandy. The chances are good a new post topic or two will emerge!\nOver to You\nHave you ever used Twitter for generating blog post ideas?\nIf so, what techniques have worked well?\nBrad Shorr is Director of Content & Social Media for Straight North, a Web development firm in Chicago. They work with firms in specialized B2B niches, from physical therapy website design to contract food packaging manufacturers. Brad has been blogging since 2005 and active on Twitter since 2008.\n(Image Credit: \u00a9 JRB #34613600  -  Fotolia.com)", "title": "Use Twitter for Blog Post Ideas"}, {"body": "A few weeks ago I wrote about lessons bloggers can learn from TV singing competitions, such as American Idol, X Factor, and The Voice. In my experience as a customer magazine editor and a blogger, the hardest thing to achieve is to maintain the momentum you gained with your first blog post or the magnificent first issue of your magazine. I was reminded about this by watching TV talent shows.\nAmerican Idol winner Scotty McCreery stuck to what he does the best: classic country music. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nMany auditions are very popular on YouTube. There are contestants that just blow us away with their audition performance, but many of them have a hard time to live up to their initial success. Do you remember Danyl Johnson from the sixth season of the UK X Factor? Simon Cowell described his performance as \"the best first audition I have ever heard\". Well, guess what? He didn't win the competition. Very soon he turned from the favorite to the most \"hated\" contestant. On the other hand, there is Olly Murs, whose audition performance was described by Cowell as \"the easiest yes I have ever given\". He maintained the momentum for the entire season and finished as a runner-up. Moreover, he's been successful even after the show: he already has several number one hits and is still a very popular artist in the UK, while the winner from the same year, Joe McElderry, hasn't found much success after the show ended.\nSo what makes Ollys Murses different from other contestants who blow us away during the auditions but cannot maintain the momentum for long? What can bloggers learn from their examples?\n1.      Human stories matter\nPeople love to watch others who struggled in their life and are now winners. The best movies are based on this premise, Oprah Winfrey shows are based on this premise, and so are American Idol type shows. It's not just about singing, it's about singers who struggle and the shows give them this great opportunity to finally share their talent with the world. We root for them; the bigger the struggle, the better the story, the better the contestant. Do you remember Chris Rene from last year's US X Factor? Chris is a recovering drug and alcohol addict, who revealed he had just been out of rehab and had been clean for just ten weeks before taking part in The X Factor auditions. He auditioned by singing one of his original songs getting a standing ovation from the audience and the judges. His personal story of struggle played a pivotal role throughout the competition.\nLikewise, bloggers should share their experience, their personal thoughts with others, because personal stories and human connections are what move consumers. That's what popular bloggers do all the time. There's nothing wrong with being personal or vulnerable. On American Idol or in the blogosphere, it is attractive.\n2.      Stick to what you're good at\nLast year's American Idol winner Scotty McCreery stuck to what he does the best. He never pretended to be versatile, from the beginning he was clear he was all about classic country music. And that's what he delivered, week after week.\nLikewise, write about things you know, write the way you write. Do not pretend to know something you don't, don't try to copy someone else's writing style. Simply, do what you're good at. And the readers will be coming back for more.\n3.      Seek unbiased opinion\nThe best part of American Idol type shows is when contestants get real, not sugarcoated feedback. That is why Simon Cowell is so popular; for the most part he says exactly what everybody else is thinking. Many times he's harsh, but can anyone really improve if he/she gets only unconditional support? Encouragement is necessary, but sometimes tough love feedback is what's needed to help contestants get to the next level.\nI couldn't apply this better to blogging than Bostjan: \"I think we should seek quality comments. Yes, it's nice to hear when others say wonderful things about your writing and posts, etc. It's human to desire attention and some tenderness. Corporate blogs may wish for as many comments as possible believing it gives their blog credibility and the feeling it's popular thus worth checking it out more often. They may boost your ego, but not much more. Comments like 'Great post!' 'Awesome!' or 'You make a good point and I look forward to reading more!' are nice to hear but nothing more. They don't really contribute to the conversation you started. /.../ I see comments the same way as I see posts: they continue/contribute to a conversation. This is how I define a quality comment. They're really hard to come by, but when they come, grab them and join the conversation.\"\n4.      Pay attention to feedback\nMany contestants who refused to learn from their mistakes or even listen to the judges have failed sooner or later. Unless they're really special or THAT good, they can't be stubborn and continue doing what they've been doing despite the advice they've been given by the industry professionals with experience. Astro was a 15-year old contestant during the first season of the US X Factor. He was a stubborn teenager who thought he knew enough and wasn't listening to anybody. His stubbornness didn't go well with the audience and he soon became unlikable and was eventually eliminated from the show.\nThe lesson here is pay attention what your readers and peers have to tell you and adapt accordingly. It doesn't matter whether you're a beginner or you've been blogging for years. Listening to other people's opinions, especially if they're your regular readers, is essential. You must be open to changes and constant learning. You will show your readers that they and their opinions matter. It's not just about you!\n5.      Choose topics relevant to your audience\nThe most successful American Idol or X Factor contestants and their mentors know how to build their music and persona around their key voting blocks. Even the producers are crafty enough to know how to pack their stories and image to appeal to their key demographic. The most obvious example is Phillip Phillips, the front-runner of this season's American Idol. The things the judges say, the way the producers portray him and how he finally succumbed to this image ... it's so obvious. That's playing smart. The biggest mistake a contestant can make is choose a song that is \"self-indulgent\", that only he/she may enjoy singing, whereas the viewers feel left out.\nLikewise, as a blogger, you need to know who your \"voting block\" is, who your primary readers are. Hence, you must always write about what is relevant to them, not only you.\nWhat else can bloggers learn from winners and losers of reality TV singing competitions? Do share.", "title": "Another 5 Lessons Bloggers Can Learn from Reality TV Singing Competitions"}, {"body": "There are millions of blogs out there. It takes a long time before you reach the steady growth of readers of your blog. Headlines may help you achieve that goal. Potential readers are looking for information, and the first thing they see on blogs is headlines. Posts' headlines are shared via social media: the headlines are the preview of your posts.\n(Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nPeople are busy even when browsing the Internet. You are competing with so many others to get their attention. They make an instant decision whether to click on the link to your post or continue reading it; the decision is based on scanning the headline. They may see a picture on your blog that attracts them to your post. The headline, however, is what really informs them about the post.\nThe headlines may be a great opportunity to be playful to attract attention, but I think one should earn enough trust of his/her audience to be allowed to play. Therefore you should write powerful, eye-catching and sharp headlines. They must make your readers curious enough to make them click. But most headlines must be informative  -  they should be as long as they need to be. Don't fall prey to those who argue for very short headlines.\nI would say that in general these are 5 most important guidelines you should follow when writing a headline for your post:\n1. The headline must be direct and tell potential readers exactly what your post is about.\n2. Let the headline be as long as it needs to be to include enough information that tell your readers what the post is really about.\n3. Make sure your headlines are as much as your posts relevant to the visitor. What is their pressing problem? Address that urgent need and promise easy-to-follow advice.\n4. Whatever your headline is, the biggest sin you can make is to not deliver on the promise you made with your headline. Yes, write a compelling headline but deliver the quality content; don't make your readers angry, don't make them feel tricked into reading. You're going to lose them forever!\n5. Brad Shorr warned against \"cheesy, overworked headlines\". He says, \"Certain headline formulas have been done to death. I'm tired of hearing about 5 things beef jerky can teach me about website design, or 10 things the Super Bowl can teach me about fluid mechanics. This sort of headline tells me a blogger is relying on gimmicks and perhaps doesn't take his/her subject matter seriously. Is this the impression you want to give prospects and customers?\"\nHere are some examples of good (attract attention, long as they need to be, informative, effective) and not so good headlines  -  of course their effectiveness depends on your blog and especially knowing your target audience well (are they relevant to them and do you deliver what you promise).\nGOOD:\n5 Steps to Getting More Targeted Website Traffic with SEO Copywriting\n7 Links That'll Make You a Better Writer and Online Marketer\nIdeas for Kick-Starting Your Content Marketing with Video and Social Media\nKlout: Has the service improved?\nNOT SO GOOD (as mentioned above, you have to build a strong loyal audience, to earn their trust that you will always deliver a great and useful post to be able to use such headlines effectively):\nThe sandwich shop that closes for lunch\nDoing the work\nLive today!\nThere are many useful posts on what types of headlines work the most. Most of them mirror the success of lifestyle magazine headlines  -  how-to and list headlines. Nenad wrote an angry post about them, but if you follow his writing on Z-Blog, you can see he's using them too, because they are informative and because they're effective. That should be the benchmark for your headlines too: do they tell the story of your post, are they attractive enough, i.e. are they relevant to your target audience.\nHow do you come up with headlines for your posts?

The story goes something like this. About five years ago, on a cold January morning, Bell played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes. During that time thousands of people went through the station. However, only 6 people stopped and stayed for a while, about 20 gave him money but continued to walk their normal pace. When he finished playing, no one applauded, nor was there any recognition. Moreover, no one knew he played one of the most intricate pieces ever written, with a violin worth 3.5 million dollars! Two days before, Joshua Bell sold out at a theater in Boston and the seats average $100. His \"concert\" at a subway station was organized by the Washington Post as part of a social experiment about perception, taste and priorities of people.\nWhat matters more: who plays, how he plays or where he does it? (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nThis case is evidence how significant context is with regard to how we perceive what is going on around us and what actions we take. The same applies to blogging. Bostjan's post on quality comments reminded me of the experiment. He writes how it usually takes a very long time before you may get the first comment on your blog and even then it takes longer time before the comments become common on your blog. On the other hand, he argues, \"blogs that already have a number of comments are far more likely to receive additional comments\".\nI have experience with writing my own blogs, guest blogging and I read tons of blogs daily. I don't have an insight into their analytics, thus I can only focus on their sharing numbers. I've noticed something: the context matters! Let's take a blogger X (he's real, but the name isn't important here). He writes his own personal blog, he also posts on his company's blog and is sometimes a guest blogger on blogs that are important in his industry. His posts are all of the same quality, they're always useful and make you think. However, when his text was posted on an already established blog, it was shared on social media significantly more than his equally great posts on his company's blog and it got exponentially more comments. Thus, it wasn't so much about who he is and what he blogs about or how, as much as where his text was posted.\nIf you're still a fresh blogger, who's trying to establish him/herself in the industry and online: guest blogging on the right blog may significantly increase your visibility and bring new readers to your blog. I advise you to do the following to increase the readership and visibility of your blog:\nWrite a guest post for a blog that matters in the area you're writing about.\nRegularly leave quality comments on other blogs that matter to your subject area.\nContribute to the conversation outside your blog, i.e. on other blogs and social media.\nWrite posts that include bloggers that matter in your industry.\nInvite bloggers that matter in your industry to write a guest post for your blog.\nWhat other suggestions do you have for fresh bloggers how to increase their visibility and attract more readers to their blogs? Let us know in the comments below.", "title": "Understanding Context: How to Increase the Visibility of Your Blog"}, {"body": "A few days ago I stumbled upon Matt Cutts's post, the Google search engine software engineer, about fake comments. He talks about the cases when somebody impersonates him on other people's blogs leaving \"nasty comments\". He calls them \"fake Matt Cutts\" impersonators who make \"crazy claims\" that are untrue.\nReal Matt Cutts or fake Matt Cutts? (Image via CrunchBase)\nYes, the web hasn't been made to prevent impersonation; even worse it allows many to pretend to be someone they're not. Many are aware of this, although sometimes we let our guards down and allow someone to dupe us. I, however, don't want to live a paranoid online life. Yes, we should be cautious, but not overly suspicious. Call me na\u00efve, but I believe in the goodness of men; therefore, it's good to know that these types of comments exist, but I wouldn't pay much attention to them, unless they're there to do harm.\nMatt's case is about another issue to ponder over  -  comments. Last week I wrote that an audience makes a blogger. Therefore, blogs are built for comments, discussions and interaction. If you're not a well-established (corporate) blogger yet, everyone will tell you it's a long, lonely and bumpy road ahead of you, before you reach the stage when comments on your blog become common. And even then you shouldn't expect a flood of comments. On the other hand, blogs that already have a number of comments are far more likely to receive additional comments. This can be explained by a simple human factor and because of course there is already a conversation going on. More comments mean there are more things for other people to comment on. However, this really depends on so many variables it's hard to give advice. Yes, the net is full of advice how to make your readers more active, we've done it too, but there is simply no magic solution to this.\nI think we should seek quality comments. Yes, it's nice to hear when others say wonderful things about your writing and posts, etc. It's human to desire attention and some tenderness. Corporate blogs may wish for as many comments as possible believing it gives their blog credibility and the feeling it's popular thus worth checking it out more often. They may boost your ego, but not much more. Comments like \"Great post!\" \"Awesome!\" or \"You make a good point and I look forward to reading more!\" are nice to hear but nothing more. They don't really contribute to the conversation you started. So my question is: would you rather get comments for getting-comments' sake or comments that matter to you and your business?\nI see comments the same way as I see posts: they continue/contribute to a conversation. This is how I define a quality comment. They're really hard to come by, but when they come, grab them and join the conversation.\nDon't give up too fast! Just because it takes time before you get your first quality comment, it doesn't necessarily mean that no one reads your blog or that no one talks about it or it doesn't make them think. Today, there are plenty other channels where the conversation about your blog or the content of your posts may go on, particularly on social media.

However, he discovered that the target audience was reading his blog: they individually email him to tell him that and say good words about it, some even call him, moreover, many have contacted him seeking advice and he has even won two paid projects; the clients contacted him themselves because of his blog!\nWhat is your take on this issue?

Pretty much all of us start doing something wanting it to last indefinitely. However, there are certain rules based mostly on common sense and experience of many that we should follow to increase the probability of our projects' endurance. Here are 5 rules to follow to make your business or corporate blog successful in the long run.\n(Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n1. Blog is only one among so many\nIn today's multimedia and complex online world, writing a blog is rarely rarely enough. You're most likely utilizing other tools to communicate with your target audience and to promote your posts. Bostjan stresses that a blogger needs an audience. So, when writing a blog for business or corporate blog, make sure it's integrated with other communication tools you use, online and offline. Don't just write and think readers will magically come. To know how to get the most out of your corporate blog, you need to know/undertand well what blog is, how you can approach it and what you can expect from it. Don't you ever start a blog just because everybody else is doing it!\nTIP: Use social media to spread the word about your blog.\n2. Don't rush into anything\nJust because you or your boss had an epiphany is not a reason enough to start a business/corporate blog. Don't rush into it without any plans whatsoever. Do you know who you're writing for? Do you know what you're going to write about? Do you know how you're going to write? Do you know how often you're going to update the blog? Bostjan warned against overcomitting oneself. I can't seem to stress enough: planning is key to sucess!\nTIP: Make thorough plans before you start blogging.\n3. Be consistent\nZ-Blog is a firm believer in publishing regular content. Thus your initial plan has to include the idea of editorial calendar. Don't ever believe you're going to come up with content when it's time to write. Forget that! Without an editorial calendar, you'll get into serious trouble sooner than later.\nTIP: Make an editorial calendar to help you plan content.\n4. Management support\nIf you're responsible for your company's blog you will need a full support by your superiors and colleagues. Many blogs have failed because they were managed by a handful of people or only one person, while others didn't quite understand what it was all about. Whoever is assigned with this they should always make sure that the company understands what benefits the company is reaping from blogging and how it's done and gain their support behind the project.\nTIP: Make sure the company stands behind the project.\n5. Measure success and adapt\nYou should constantly measure the success of your blog (based on defined goals and benchmarks from your project plan). There are many tools out there that measure the engagement with your blog online, such as Google Statistics, that are easy to use. Is there a steady growth  of readership? What posts seem to be the most popular? What posts/topics seem to generate most comments? What days do you get most readers? How long on average do they spend on your blog? What is your bounce rate? Whatever you learn from regularly observing how your blog is being consumed use it and simply adapt  -  make your blog better, better for your readers.\nTIP: Regularly observe how your blog is consumed and adapt accordingly.\nDo you agree with these 5 rules?

(Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n\"You are a blogger when you do things just to blog about them later.\" MeRu's World\nA few weeks ago I argued that the blogosphere has come out of age. I discussed the latest research that shows a significant increase in blogging in the last few years. \"This just means that blogs have become indispensable, they are not just a new kid in town anymore,\" I wrote. After the post was published another blogger asked me who I thought a blogger is. His question was the revival of blogger/journalist/columnist discussion that has been going on for years. There is still no definite answer to this trilemma and I don't think there ever will be. However, he made me think, and you know as a philosopher I live to think.\nOur discussion went on for a while. His main argument was that he's a journalist, a brand journalist, and he also writes his own blog: \"When I think of a post and the way I approach it it's the same I do it when I write an article for a magazine or newspaper. So what's the difference?\" He reminded me of that little HBO show Sex and the City rarely any of us guys would admit watching it at the time. If the show were made today, would Carrie be a newspaper columnist or a blogger?\nThe lines are increasingly blurring between blogging and journalism. Do you remember the debate at the end of last year when Montana blogger Crystal Cox lost a federal case focusing on an Oregon law that protects journalists from having to reveal sources? A federal judge ruled that under Oregon law, she did not qualify as a journalist. However, many bloggers now contribute to, or work full time in, traditional publications. On the other hand, many blogs today resemble traditional media online: check out TechCrunch or The Huffington Post. Are they journalists or bloggers? Or is it a personal choice? And there are some who are everything; for example, an award winning journalist Lincoln Spector also writes a blog where he identifies himself as \"journalist, columnist, blogger and sometimes humorist\". He's the whole package!\nThis is what I think. Utilizing WordPress doesn't make you a blogger. Choosing a catchy name for your blog doesn't make you a blogger. Just because you're writing doesn't make you a blogger. The audience, your readers make you a blogger. If you're a columnist or a journalist, it is the publication you write for that brings you your audience. A blogger, if he/she's not already a known columnist or journalist, has to work hard to attract readers to the blog and to keep them coming back.\nIn the end, what someone is called is the matter of the industry terminology. It's more about the relationship between content and consumers. It's about the quality of the content you are producing and sharing. Not so much about who did it. We're all publishers. Journalism, social media and blogging mean publishing. It's about content creation and content sharing. And that's all it matters.\nWhat is your take on \"Who is a blogger?\" debate?

That is a key point. They write and I review, edit, advise, and, like any coach, challenge them to learn, grow and reach higher to meet their goals.\nI have been writing for more than 25 years and I maintain two blogs of my own in addition to assisting multiple clients with their blogging.\nMy focus with my clients is to help them find the right topics, write well, use links and photos effectively, to consider some SEO best practices, write content that matters to them and meet the needs of their target audience.\nWhat are some common challenges business owners have maintaining their blog?\nComing up with Ideas - developing new ideas can be more difficult than you think. I work with clients to come up with ideas that are easy for them to write about from their immediate business and life experience, challenges, lessons learned and analysis of new ideas, tools and best practices.\nWhat is the Posting Schedule? - how often to blog? This depends on the blogger. Once a week is great, Twice a week is better, but often unrealistic for a small business. Every two weeks works and is better than no blogging at all. SEO (via Google) improves significantly with a weekly post.\nCoordinate Blogging Strategy with Other Marketing Initiatives - A blog coach will work with you to coordinate your blogging with your other marketing and PR initiatives to maximize the reach and investment you have in your blog.\nBuilding Out Starting Thoughts - it can be a challenge to share best practices in a focused, simple writing stye for a blog, so a coach can really help you fine tune your writing and make a strong point quickly.\nGrammar and Punctuation - a coach can review, edit and proof, but in many cases, organizations have someone internally who is excellent at proofing and I recommend involving other team members in a blog whenever possible.\nLong-term Blogging Strategy - a coach can help you look at the long-term picture with blogging and planning. Many bloggers stop blogging at the 1 or 2-year mark, so a coach can help you with some innovative strategies to keep it fresh and interesting for you with ideas about vlogging, photo blogs, interviews, methods of writing for compelling brief posts, ways to repackage other content for your blog and much more.\nWorking with Guest Bloggers - when a business owner invites someone to guest blog, a coach is great about working with the guest blogger to make sure they adhere to the style and standards for that blog. Blog coaches often create guest blog guidelines for their clients.\nResponding to Comments - blog coaches advise about how to comment, respond to comments and to build relationships with those who take the time to comment on your blog.\nHandling Controversy - a blog coach can advise you about steps to take with negative blog comments or what to do if your content is 'stolen' and re-posted on another blog without proper credit given to the original blogger.\nUsing Plug-ins and Widgets - if you are using a WordPress blog, there are so many software tools to enhance the blog presentation and experience. A blog coach can advise you on some of the technology options to make your content really stand out.\nPromotional Strategies on Social Media - make sure your blog is shared with your audience. A blog coach can advise you on dashboard tools, such as Hootsuite and TweetDeck, and best practices for blog promotion using social media, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, e-news and more.\nWhat challenges do you experience with maintaining your blog?

I seem to start a blog, whether it's personal or business-related, update it for a period and then just disconnect it. The average age of each of my deceased blogs was like my romantic relationships, some were done in just a few days, some lasted a year or more.\nCreated in Photoshop, based on \"Sustainable development\" diagram at Cornell Sustainability Campus (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\nTool for sustainable blogging\nFew weeks back, Zemanta introduced a new project called Blogspire, which is currently in beta  -  a tool for sustainable blogging. Sustainable blogging, of course, what a concept! Political scientists, agriculture experts, activists and economists have been talking about the sustainable development for a long time. What everybody talks about is the capacity to endure. However, blogs haven't been around enough to legitimately discuss their sustainability. On the other hand, they've been around just enough to make an educated guess about their sustainability.\nWhat is a blog's average life expectancy?\nHave you ever asked yourself how long you'd like your blog to live, be a personal or a corporate blog? Have you ever made any plans regarding your blog for more than a year or even a decade ahead? When I was introduced to the idea of sustainable blogging, I was literally in intellectual shock. Things around us change so fast, it seems like we are incapable of making lifelong plans, especially regarding new media. We've read so many blogs and we've written so many of them on how to do a good blog, how to write and how many times to do it etc., but we've rarely ever pondered on the life expectancy of a great blog. Is it too short to be discussed?\nWhat do you want to get out of your blog?\nPosts about sustainable blogging usually focus on two issues. First, do bloggers know what they want to get out of their blogs? Darren Rowse, the founder and editor of ProBlogger Blog Tips, made an insightful short video almost 5 years ago. His argument is that blogs should benefit two groups of people: readers and bloggers. And every blogger should get the balance right, so that no group dominates, otherwise this will be the end of their blog. Brad Shorr writes about how blogs shouldn't become information charities. He was basically writing about conversion, i.e. knowing what exactly you want to get out of your blog.\nHow many times is too many times?\nSecond, there is mainly a discussion on how many times we should update our blogs. It's an interesting dilemma. On Z-Blog, we've often cited research, which show that to increase the readership of your blog you should blog as often as possible, best is if you do it daily. On the other hand, bloggers who write about sustainable blogging argue that blogs with more posts  -  a \"more more more\" strategy according to Seth Werkheiser  -  are eventually doomed to failure: \"But with more posts  -  just like more ads  -  when do people start tuning out?\" So which is it?\nI stopped blogging so many times mostly because I couldn't sustain it. So many times I did everything right, save overcommitting myself. My history shows I start a new blog when I have a lot of \"free time\". I make wonderful plans. However as soon as I become too busy again, I can hardly stick to the plan. I can't keep up with regular posting anymore and feel bad about it. Sounds familiar, right? This applies to blogs by individuals as well as corporate blogs. In one of my previous jobs, we started a blog on my initiative. Soon it became clear that everyone was so busy we rarely updated the blog. It became clinically dead. Last week, Bostjan in his post on how to update a blog more often stressed: \"If you're a one-man band and not a serial writer then you should think carefully how many posts you can really manage a month.\" Puglypixel blog points out: \"Consistency doesn't just mean posting regularly every day. It can mean posting with consistent quality. It can mean posting with consistent excitement and enthusiasm. And it can mean being consistently true to yourself and posting only when you feel like it.\"\nMore a philosophy than a set of rules\nI think we will continue to read and give advice on how to do successful blogging which entails sustainable/enduring blogging. Kim De, a freelance writer and author of Zen Kitchen, a blog focused on recipes and food issues, though reminds us that \"sustainable agriculture is more a philosophy than a strict set of rules, and the same applies for blogging. Find what works for you and stick with it.\" The best advice I could give you.\nWhat is your opinion on sustainable blogging? Is it a buzzword, an oxymoron or a real deal?

He said he was having trouble updating his blog regularly, mostly because he doesn't have enough time to devote himself to high quality posts. Sounds familiar? As Nenad wrote this week, nobody's perfect, therefore, we should stop obsessing about quality to the detriment of rarely making ourselves write. Here are 3 rules to follow to update your blog regularly.\nHow many times a month should I write? (Photo credit: Wikipedia)\n1. Don't overthink\nOnce again, nobody's perfect. Moreover, only a few of your posts will be perfect or rather almost perfect. My advice is simple: don't overthink it. What I mean is stop worrying so much about the quality of your post. This may sound ridiculous in the world where we constantly, for a reason, talk about quality content. I'm not saying, publish whatever or that quality doesn't matter. Quite the contrary. It's just that many times we are too critical. Look! Whatever you write (unless you're not a good writer), it will be about 80 per cent all right. So don't wait, just write.\n2. Don't overcommit yourself\nTo update a blog daily, especially if you're very busy, is daunting. Come on! Lift this burden from your shoulders. Content marketing teaches us we should post as many times a week as possible. Even research shows that the more often a company updates its blog, the more readers it gets. But if you're a one-man band and not a serial writer then you should think carefully how many posts you can really manage a month.\nRecently I began to exercise again. I decided to do it every morning. At first it was a struggle to make myself do it daily. After a while I discovered that I don't need to exercise an hour each morning, sometimes fifteen minutes are plenty  -  better than no exercising at all. This is how exercising has become less frightening. Moreover, it has turned into a habit of mine.\nI apply the same philosophy to blogging. It should become your habit. My own approach is to write three to four longer, more analytical posts a month, but to keep myself writing,  I post shorter opinions on other days; I usually reblog other blogs and add my own short opinion to it. So it's better to write something than nothing in my case. There are two levels of quality: great and less great. What it comes to is to train your audience when to expect a new post. If you decide to publish once a week, that's fine, however, stick to the schedule. To sum up, if you're a lone blogger, make sure you know how many times a month you really can commit to posting and stick to it.\n3. Guest blogging\nAllowing others to guest post on your blog is beneficial for so many reasons. First, it lifts the burden of having to write something on a regular basis. Second, known bloggers improve the credibility and even increase traffic to your blog. Third, you keep up the level of quality, especially during dry spells or if you're too busy to stick to your commitment  -  both can happen from time to time. Choose your guest bloggers carefully.\nWith regard to my own personal blog, I follow the first two rules, which made me get back to blogging and they made me happier. Guest blogging is what we do on the Z-Blog, thus making sure we post as many quality posts as possible as many times a week as possible. There's simply too much great content out there waiting to be written and posted online.\nWhat is your advice about how to make updating blog a habit?
